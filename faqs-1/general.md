# General

#### **This seems too good to be true. What's the catch?**

The bounties you're seeing on TechTree are equivalent to the fees companies have historically being paying to technical recruiters.&#x20;

We're helping companies realise that the best ambassadors for their business are devs. And, the fees should be paid to you instead. It's that simple.

We make our money through subscriptions and an additional transaction fee charged to the company when we an application or referral comes from outside of a companies extended network.

#### **What is a creator?**

A creator is a developer who has:

* "created" a bounty board on TechTree
* posted an article or video
* run or spoken at an event
* or created a splash page

Essentially, anything that a user has "created" on TechTree and belongs to that user. If a creators bounty board, article or event attracts a user to TechTree who then goes on to apply for a job or refer someone then that creator gets rewarded to. It's what's called [Creator rights](../roles-at-techtree/creator-rights.md).

#### **When do I get paid if either myself, or someone I refer, is hired?**

Payment will take place 90 days after the start date and once we have confirmed with the company that they're still employed.
