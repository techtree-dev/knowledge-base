We do not allow profiles that impersonate or misrepresent their affiliation with any person or organisation.

We do not allow self plagiarism (multiple posting of the same content) on TechTree on a single or across multiple profiles. We do allow you to cross-post content from other sites onto TechTree, provided you either own the rights to the content, or have permission from the owner to do so along with crediting them.

Plagiarism of any type is not tolerated on the TechTree platform. Once discovered, reported, or investigated, TechTree reserves the right to remove any plagiarised content, and if necessary remove any profiles involved.

Profiles spreading or promoting the above content will be reviewed, and potentially removed from the TechTree platform. Any content that could be labelled as misinformation, disinformation, or malinformation will be swiftly removed.

**Harassment and criticism**

Whilst constructive criticism when requested can be helpful and assist to further learning, unnecessary or harmful criticism and any form of harassment will not be tolerated. Harassment is also covered in our [Code of Conduct](https://www.notion.so/Code-of-Conduct-ad27c77f13e34c2485bbc6a2fd45f36e), criticism and harassment include, but is not limited to the following:

* Criticism involving name-calling, profanity and other insulting language or imagery.
* Mocking someone for their experiences or lack thereof
* Mocking someone for how they express themselves, be it their language skills - verbal or written, or their emotions.

Any content found to be harassing or harmfully critical will be removed from the platform. Should a profile repeatedly engage in such behaviour, that profile will also be removed from TechTree.
