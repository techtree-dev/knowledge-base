# Getting rewarded

### **Become an open-source knowledge pioneer**

At TechTree, we're building a community that's just for devs. We want technical people - like you - to support each other in levelling up your 'not code' portfolio and to get rewarded the more you contribute and help.

By sharing your knowledge on TechTree, you'll become a pioneer of the open-source knowledge movement making your knowledge and insights accessible to all.

### Help other developers level up

#### How you can get involved

1.  ****[**Create your TechTree profile**](creating-your-profile.md)****

    Start building the home for your 'not code' portfolio by sharing links to resources that are important to you, for example your blog on [medium.com](http://medium.com), your top StackOverflow question, your personal website, and more.

    Once your account is setup we can make sure that referral links you create are credited to you.
2.  **Join the** [**Contributor Airtable**](https://airtable.com/shribrqEDr8IKEvX2)

    Register your interest in creating content. It doesn't matter if you've never created content before or if you don't yet have a fully fleshed out idea. We'll be there to support and help you share your knowledge in an impactful way. In the coming months, we'll be setting up an online community where you'll be able to ask for help and get feedback from other devs.
3.  **Create and share content**

    Whether it's content you've created on your own or in collaboration with one of the +200 technical communities that are partnered with Techtree, by publishing it on TechTree you're ensuring your content is reaching many more like-minded developers.

#### Getting the rewards ðŸŽ‰

By creating and sharing content, you're shining a light on the innovative tech you're building and the way your team works.

If you've created a tracked referral link that points to your content, and someone applies for a role after following your link then you'll gain a reward (average is \~Â£8K). What's more, the new joiner will be forever marked as invited to TechTree by you. This means if they ever win any bounties on TechTree, you'll get 10%. It doesn't matter if that future bounty is won tomorrow or in 10 years time.

Adding referral links to content showcasing your knowledge means that job openings are more likely to be seen by the people who are already interested in what you're building and how you work.

#### It doesn't need to be hard or scary either!

The thought of sharing your knowledge and putting yourself out there can be daunting one, especially if combined with time restraints and build pressures. What if you take the time to create something to share and no one engages with it? Or worse, what if you're wrong about a topic?

You'd be surprised by the knowledge you have that is worth sharing. Implemented a new tool or feature? Encountered challenges and gotchas along the way? Had to research what the best tool to was to solve a specific problem? Share your journey and process because that's knowledge that deserves sharing. You could save another developer hours, if not days!

If you're not sure what to talk, write, or otherwise shout about then let us help. The TechTree community will be able to offer advice and support when it comes to showcasing your knowledge.

Knowledge sharing shouldn't be a burden, it should be uplifting!
