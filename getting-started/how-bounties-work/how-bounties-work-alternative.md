#### **How does it work?**

**Referrer + Applicant**

1. The Referrer creates a tracked referral link and shares it with a potential Applicant either by messaging them themselves or by using TechTree's system.
2. The Applicant will receive a message that they have been recommended for a role.
3. The Applicant applies for the role and is successful.
4. The Referrer and the Applicant share the Bounty determined by sliders set by the Referrer.

The Referrer can use the sliders to determine how much of the Bounty goes to themselves, the Applicant and/or a charity if won.

**Referrer + Applicant + Sharer **

1. The Sharer posts a tracked link on social media that invites users to TechTree.
2. The Referrer uses the link the Sharer posts when creating their account. They then take a look at open roles on TechTree.
3. The Referrer goes through the process outlined in Referrer + Sharer.
4. The Referrer, the Applicant, and the Sharer all win a portion of the Bounty determined by sliders set by the Referrer.

**(Coming soon) Referrer + Applicant + Sharer + Creator**

1. The Creator publishes a piece of content on the TechTree platform.
2. The Sharer discovers the content and decides to share, starting the process outlined in Referrer + Applicant + Sharer.
3. The Referrer, the Applicant, the Sharer, and the Creator all win a portion of the Bounty determined by sliders set by the Referrer_._
