### What are Creator rights?

Youâ€™ve taken the time to put something together to open-source your knowledge, and itâ€™s that knowledge that brings people together on TechTree. Itâ€™s what helps the community grow, not just in size but also in personal and professional development.

**It only makes sense that you get rewarded for doing so.**

When another TechTree user lands on something you created, we'll set a cookie with a short expiry in that user's browser. During that time, should they submit a claim for a Bounty, whether itâ€™s applying for a job or referring a friend, youâ€™ll be listed as the Creator that helped kickstart that Bounty claim chain. This means you could be rewarded as much as 50% of that Bounty!

Any time you create or curate on TechTree, from articles and video posts to talks and Bounty boards, you unlock Creator rights benefits.

### The Bounty claim chain

Bounties are available for a number of things on TechTree. At the moment, the most common is a hiring Bounty. When a Bount claim is made, there can be as many as four different people who can be rewarded:

**The Applicant** - the one who is applying to win claim a Bounty&#x20;

**The Referrer** - the one who suggests the Applicant should submit for a Bounty.&#x20;

**The Creator** - the one who creates something that directly leads to the Applicant submitting a claim on a Bounty, for example the author of an article that the Applicant read before applying for a role.&#x20;

**The Sharer** - the one who generates and shares a tracked TechTree link that causes either the Referrer or the Applicant to join the platform.
