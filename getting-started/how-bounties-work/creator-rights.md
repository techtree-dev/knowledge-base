# Creator rights

#### Articles, Video posts, Talks & Bounty boards are owned by you

Anything you create or curate is owned by you. This ownership confers you with `Creator rights`.

When another user lands on something you created, we'll set a cookie with a short expiry in that user's browser.

Now, should that user submit a claim for a bounty or refer a friend for a bounty before the `Creator rights` cookie has expired, then you'll be listed as the `Creator` that help enable the claim. This confers you as much as 50% of the quoted bounty connected with the claim.

#### Share of bounty

Bounties can be offered for all manner of things. A common use case is a hiring bounty.

When a bounty claim is submitted there can be as many as 4 different people who stand to benefit:

* The claimant (the person submitting the claim) / in the case of a hiring bounty this is the applicant
* The referrer / the user who suggested another user should submit a claim
* The creator / the user who's creation directly led to a claim being submitted (eg the author of an article that a claimant read before applying for a job)
* The sharer / the user who shared a link to TechTree that was followed by a claimant or referrer

Here we're interested in the `Creator`. Essentially, if you're creation help enable a bounty claim then you can be entitled to as much as 50% of the quoted bounty connected with the claim.
