### **Let us take you on a journey...**

Alex has seen a job on a Bounty Board on TechTree that he thinks his friend, Morgan would be great for. Alex becomes a Referrer as he sends Morgan a tracked link for the role.

Morgan thinks the role is right up their street and applies. They have now become an Applicant. Because Morgan and the role are a match made in Heaven, Morgan is hired. Alex and Morgan split the bounty between them because this type of friendship should be rewarded!

**Let's kick it up a notch.**

The whole reason Alex heard of TechTree and the Bounty Boards is because his other friend, Jane recommended us and send him a tracked link to sign up. Because she shared TechTree with people she knew would love us, Jane is a Sharer.

As a reward for being a pioneer and opening the TechTree gates to her network, Jane is rewarded part of the bounty when Morgan is hired. Amazing! And don't worry, Alex and Morgan still split the bounty promised. Double amazing.
