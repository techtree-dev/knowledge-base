# How Bounties work

### **What are Bounties?**

Bounties are are `requests for help`. As an example, if a new startup needs to hire a CTO they can publish the role on TechTree and attach a bounty to it. The bounty is a request to the community for help in finding someone good.

### **What types of Bounties are possible?**

Currently, we have `hiring bounties only` but we're excited about the possibility of bounties and can see them being extended to all manner of areas, for example:

* Content Bounties - Requests for help creating content for companies technical blog
* Speaking Bounties - Requests for help filling a speaker slot at an upcoming event
* Mentoring Bounties - Requests for help in finding great mentors for a community
* Bug Bounties - Requests for help in finding bugs/security flaws in open source or even proprietary codebases
* And much more...

### **Here's a Hiring Bounty ðŸ’° example**

Imagine, Alice has seen a job on a Bounty Board (with a bounty of **$10,000**) on TechTree that she thinks her friend, Bob would be great for. Alice becomes a Referrer and sends Bob a tracked link for the role. Alice also decides to split the bounty 50:50 with Bob.

Bob thinks the role is right up their street and applies. Bob has become an Applicant. Because Bob and the role are a match made in Heaven, Bob is hired. Alice and Bob split the bounty between them because this type of friendship should be rewarded!

**Let's kick it up a notch.**

The whole reason Alice heard of TechTree and the Bounty Boards is because her other friend, Charlie recommended TechTree and send Alice a tracked link to sign up. Because Charlie shared TechTree with people he knew would love us, Charlie is a Sharer.

As a reward for being a pioneer and opening up TechTree to his network, Charlie is rewarded with part of the bounty when Bob is hired. Amazing! And don't worry, Alice and Bob still split the bounty as promised. Double amazing.

**Here's a worked example**
