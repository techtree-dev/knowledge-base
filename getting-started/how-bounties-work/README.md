### **Learn the lingo**

#### **Referrer**

Referrers are the people who know people. If you know someone who's a great fit for a bounty, all you need to do is share the tracked referral link with them. If they apply and are successfully hired, congrats! You and your friend get to share the bounty, you for referring them and them for getting a new job!

#### **Applicant**

The person who is applying for the job, need we say more? But we will anyway, whether you've been told about the job by someone or found it yourself, as long as you've hit that 'apply' button you're an applicant to us. If youâ€™re successful in your application, youâ€™ll win part of or a full bounty, depending on how you found out about the role.

#### **Sharer**

You're a trendsetter. A pioneer of the next big thing. You've discovered TechTree and you want to share it with friends, colleagues and country-people. When someone joins TechTree using the tracked link you shared, you'll receive a piece of any bounty they win. Just a little way we want to say 'thank you' for sharing TechTree with the world.

#### **Creator (coming soon)**

The keyholders for unlocking tech knowledge potential. The ones who have taken the time to open source your knowledge, making people want to check out TechTree. It's only fair that we reward you for doing so.

### **Let us take you on a journey...**

Alex has seen a job on a Bounty Board on TechTree that he thinks his friend, Morgan would be great for. Alex becomes a Referrer as he sends Morgan a tracked link for the role.

Morgan thinks the role is right up their street and applies. They have now become an Applicant. Because Morgan and the role are a match made in Heaven, Morgan is hired. Alex and Morgan split the bounty between them because this type of friendship should be rewarded!

**Let's kick it up a notch.**

The whole reason Alex heard of TechTree and the Bounty Boards is because his other friend, Jane recommended us and send him a tracked link to sign up. Because she shared TechTree with people she knew would love us, Jane is a Sharer.

As a reward for being a pioneer and opening the TechTree gates to her network, Jane is rewarded part of the bounty when Morgan is hired. Amazing! And don't worry, Alex and Morgan still split the bounty promised. Double amazing.
