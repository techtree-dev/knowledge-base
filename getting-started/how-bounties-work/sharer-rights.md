# Sharer rights

### Tracked links are owned by you

TechTree is built on the idea that it should be owned by its users. And that any actions that grow the community should be rewarded.

If you generate a tracked link using any one of the `share` buttons scattered around the site. That'll create a link to that page that you can share around.

When other Devs discover TechTree via your link, they'll be permanently associated with your account. This is great, because it entitles you to a share of any bounties that are claimed by users who joined via you. 

### Share of bounty

Bounties can be offered for all manner of things. A common use case is a hiring bounty.

When a bounty claim is submitted there can be as many as 4 different people who stand to benefit:
- The claimant (the person submitting the claim) / in the case of a hiring bounty this is the applicant
- The referrer / the user who suggested another user should submit a claim
- The creator / the user who's creation directly led to a claim being submitted (eg the author of an article that a claimant read before applying for a job)
- The sharer / the user who shared a link to TechTree that was followed by a claimant or referrer

Here we're interested in the `Sharer`. Essentially, the more users who joined TechTree via links you shared, the more likely you are to benefit from `Sharer rights` when those users submit bounty claims or refer people.
