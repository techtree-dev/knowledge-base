# âž• Worked Example

**The Scenario**

Satoshi Nakamoto joins TechTree and posts an article about cryptography. Satoshi has become a Creator.



Charlie follows Satoshi and sees his article in his feed. Charlie clicks share which generates a personalised tracked link for Charlie that points at Satoshi's article.



Charlie shares the link with Alice who follows it. Whilst Alice is reading Satoshi's article she sees a role at WayFlyer with a $10,000 bounty. Alice knows Wayflyer, and Alice knows her friend Bob (who is a product designer) is looking for a new gig so she refers Bob. Alice has become a Referrer.&#x20;



Bob receives a referral link from Alice via WhatsApp and clicks follows it to the Wayflyer role on TechTree. Bob applies for the role and becomes an Applicant.



A short time later, Bob is invited to interview. Impresses the WayFlyer team and is hired. After 2 mths has passed if Bob is still working with Wayflyer the full rewards will be distributed to all claimants.
