### Our Bounty Fee

Your proposed bounty price is what bounty hunters will see on our board, and what they will be paid (in full) if they refer someone whom you hire or apply themselves.\
\
TechTree's fees are 15% of your proposed bounty if the hire comes from outside your network. We track can track referrals to your dev teams and friends of the company via tracked link and associations in our database.

### General Candidates

We're constantly in touch with great talent who might not be an exact match for a posted bounty, but who we think you'd want to meet anyway.

If these general candidates turn into **a hire for one of your non-TechTree-posted roles**, we price using default bounties of:\
\
15% of the annual salary that you agree in the event of a successful hire.

### Picking a Bounty Price

If youâ€™re posting a specific role for a bounty, how you price it is totally up to you.\
\
Recruiting is a hard problem - this price should reflect what you feel you need to spend, in order to get this hard problem solved by someone who can help you.
