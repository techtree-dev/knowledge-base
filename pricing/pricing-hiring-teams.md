### **Subscription Fee**

To start posting bounties we require you to sign up for a modest ðŸ’° **Â£200 / mth** which gives you the ability to post and unlimited amount of bounties.

If the hire comes from **inside your network**, there is no bounty fee (**Â£ 0**).

If the hire comes from **outside your network**, TechTree's fees are **15% of your proposed bounty**.&#x20;

We can track referrals to your dev teams and friends of the company via tracked link and associations in our database.

### Picking a Bounty Price

If youâ€™re posting a specific role for a bounty, how you price it is totally up to you.\
\
Recruiting is a hard problem - this price should reflect what you feel you need to spend, in order to get this hard problem solved by someone who can help you.
