Weâ€™d be nowhere without you, Sharer. Youâ€™re the one who helps out others when it comes to the latest trends and updates. Without you, weâ€™d all still be wearing skinny jeans. You lift up others by sharing resources and content you know will benefit them. We want to reward you for this altruistic behavior because we recognise that weâ€™d be seriously uncool without you.

### The best thing about Sharers is that anyone can be one!&#x20;

#### Help friends level up&#x20;

Whenever you invite a friend to TechTree that friend is forever connected to you. When your friend wins a Bounty, any Bounty, youâ€™ll also get rewarded as a â€˜thank youâ€™ for introducing them to the TechTree adventure. What a great way to celebrate friendship!&#x20;

#### Support the Creators who support you&#x20;

Help the Creators you love gain engagement and views on the knowledge theyâ€™ve curated by sharing the content with those who you think need to see it. These are the Creators who may have helped you solve a technical problem or showed you a more efficient process. By supporting Creators in this way, you can help the community grow and ensure that the open-source knowledge movement really is open to all.&#x20;

#### Get rewarded for boosting and sharing with others&#x20;

Through sharing referral links, knowledge from Creators and invites to join TechTree, youâ€™re a triple threat when it comes to helping others level up. Making sure you get rewarded is our way of making sure you get to level up too.
