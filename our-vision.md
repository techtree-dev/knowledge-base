# Our Vision

We're building the **first socioeconomic network for tech people**. A platform that helps people unlock the value of their networks, knowledge and reputation.

### The future

Hiring bounties and content bounties are just the beginning. We can envisage all manner of bounties funded by companies for all manner of activities, fueling the community: speaker bounties, patronage bounties, mentoring bounties, Q\&A bounties, bug bounties and more.

### How the TechTree community can support open source?

Tens of thousands of businesses worldwide rely on the code written by volunteers. This is not right, nor is it sustainable without issues cropping up.

We see an opportunity to help address this issue. For many people, the reward of helping a friend find a great role is enough - for these people, we want to give them a chance to donate some or all of their rewards to projects - and be recognised for their contribution.&#x20;

What's more, we want to encourage companies and teams to set up regular donations to open-source projects via TechTree. All of which can be cleanly and transparently facilitated by our Token (TechTree Token | TTT). See our [litepaper](broken-reference) for more details.

We think we're well placed to promote that behaviour as we can celebrate and promote teams & companies that are contributing. Helping to support the open source community whilst building community and credibility around dev teams at the same time.

### What has inspired TechTree?

_Businesses with uncapped and transparent earning potential for creators. Theyâ€™re aware that their success is made possible by the community and the network effects that they help drive._

Whilst there are a few community-focused businesses and systems out there, these are our favourite three because they understand the importance of rewarding creators and the community:

* Roblox
* Crypto ecosystems
* AirBnB

[Pawel ](https://www.linkedin.com/in/paweltomczuk/)and [Stas](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stanislas-de-roquemaurel-galitzine-a98b9a57/), our CEO and CTO, have spent a while being involved in businesses operating in the crypto space. This has influenced the thinking at TechTree, especially business models that emerged thanks to blockchain.
