**Short version**

TechTree is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of sex, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, or religion (or lack thereof). We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate at any TechTree community event or social group. Participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from these events and groups at the discretion of the TechTree team.

**Detailed version**

Harassment includes, but is not limited to, offensive verbal comments related to sex, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion or lack thereof, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. Participants asked to stop any harassing behaviour are expected to comply immediately.

If a participant engages in harassing behaviour, the TechTree team may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from events and/or other TechTree social groups without notice. If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact the TechTree team immediately. The team will be happy to help participants contact local law enforcement, provide support, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe within the TechTree community and online social groups. We value your participation and want to ensure that everyone feels safe.

Be responsible. Ensure that the consequences of your actions are for the good of everyone in the community. We expect participants to be conscious of their actions to not detract from the TechTree community as a whole or the experience and comfort for other members for personal gain.

**And remember - be excellent to one another!**
