# What is TechTree

We're building the first social economic network for devs & their teams. No spam. Own what you create. Support open source. A platform that helps devs & tech people unlock the value of their networks, knowledge and data. For us, bounties are the key - and we've started with hiring bounties.

### We've starting with Hiring Bounties ðŸ’°

We've started by focusing on a tricky problem, technical recruitment. Many scale-up tech companies - perhaps ones you've worked in - struggle to attract and keep great people. And - from our perspective, as developers - we know how frustrating it can be to get an endless stream of emails / in-mail / phone-calls from recruiters offering roles at companies we've either never heard of that they can't even tell us the name of the company they're hiring for.

That's why we've introduced the idea of hiring bounties ðŸ’°. The goal is to create a fair incentive structure that encourages us - the developers - to think of people we know and refer them into teams we're connected to. It's about getting a few highly personal recommendations rather than an endless stream of cold emails.

In our opinion, it's us, the developers - and our networks - that are best placed to attract new developers to a team.&#x20;

It's our job at TechTree, to help companies understand this value and reward teams and their friends accordingly.

> **What's more, we want to make it easy for our community to donate some - or all of the rewards they earn - to open source projects and communities and publicly recognise those contributions over time. We are excited about doing the same with companies - publicly recognising the contributions teams and companies make over time**

### What's next?

Once we've established that [**hiring bounties**](how-it-works/how-bounties-work/hiring-bounties/) are a great way for teams to hire, and for developers to realise the value of their networks, we want to extend the concept of bounties and use it fuel a community where devs can learn, connect, share knowledge and team up.

The next step is bringing content creation to life on TechTree. If you're a content creator, your options for generating income from your content are currently super limited.

On TechTree, thanks to [**Creator rights**](how-it-works/how-bounties-work/creator-rights.md), everything you create, you own. Our platform links content - that helps create a successful bounty claims - to a claim payout. Meaning - in principle - the more you create and share knowledge the more you can earn on TechTree.

### The future

Hiring bounties and content bounties are just the beginning. We can envisage all manner of bounties funded by companies for all manner of activities, fuelling the community.

### Open source projects

We're also excited about the possibility of the community contributing the rewards they get from bounties to many of the underfunded open source projects that prop up most enterprise apps.
