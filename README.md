# Overview

We're building the **first socio-economic network for devs & their teams**. No spam. Own what you create. Support for open-source. A platform where people in the tech space can unlock the value of their networks, knowledge and data. For us, bounties are the key - and we've started with hiring bounties.

### Why are we building TechTree?

Weâ€™re building TechTree because we believe it should be simple for people to help each other and get rewarded when their actions create value for others and organisations.

Our goal at TechTree is to create an environment in which: tech people can help each other through content, mentoring, events, and more, but also unlock the value of their network, knowledge, and data; and turn it into a meaningful source of income.

There are two key areas we're focused on:

* the budgets companies set aside for technical hiring
* and Web 2.0 platforms that reach multi-billion dollar valuations on the backs of their users need to self-express, create and share content without sharing any of the value

### How are we doing this?

We are starting with [**hiring bounties**](how-it-works/how-bounties-work/hiring-bounties/) ðŸ’° since they are a great way for companies to hire, and for users to realise the value of their networks. The goal is to create a fair incentive structure that encourages people to think of people they know and refer them to companies we're connected to. It's about getting a few highly personal recommendations rather than an endless stream of cold emails. In our opinion, it's people and their networks - that are best placed to attract new developers to a team.

After, we will extend the concept of bounties and use it to fuel a community where devs can learn, connect, share knowledge and team up.

The next step is bringing content creation to life on TechTree. If you're a content creator, your options for generating income from your content are currently super limited.

On TechTree, thanks to the [**Creator rights**](how-it-works/how-bounties-work/hiring-bounties/roles-within-the-hiring-bounties/creator-rights.md), everything you create, you own. Our platform links to content - that helps create successful bounty claims - to a claim payout. Meaning - in principle - the more you create and share knowledge the more you can earn on TechTree.
