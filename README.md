### We've starting with Hiring Bounties ðŸ’°

We've started by focusing on a tricky problem, technical recruitment. Many scale-up tech companies - perhaps ones you've worked in - struggle to attract and keep great people. And - from our perspective as developers - we know how frustrating it can be to get an endless stream of emails / in-mail / phone-calls from recruiters offering roles at companies we've either never heard of or that they can't tell us the name of even.

That's why we've introduced the idea of hiring bounties ðŸ’°. The goal is to create a fair incentive structure that encourages us - the developers - to think of people we know and refer them into teams we're connecting to. It's about a few highly personal recommendations rather than an endless stream of cold emails.

In our opinion, it's us, the developers - and our friends - in each dev team that are the best people best placed to attract developers to a team.&#x20;

It's our job at TechTree, to help companies understand this value and reward teams and their friends accordingly.

> _**What's more, we want to make it easy for our community to donate some - or all of the rewards they earn - to open source projects and communities and publicly recognise those contributions over time. We are excited about doing the same with companies - publicly recognising the contributions teams and companies make over time**_

### What's next?

Once we've established that hiring bounties are a great way for teams to hire, and for developers to realise the value of their networks, we want to extend the concept of bounties and use it fuel a community where devs can learn, connect, share knowledge and team up.

The next concrete step in that process is bringing to life content creation on TechTree. If you're a content creator, your options for generating income from your content are currently super limited.

On TechTree, thanks to [Creator rights](getting-started/how-bounties-work/creator-rights.md), everything you create, you own. Our platform links content that helped  successful bounty claims&#x20;
