# What is TechTree

### Learn from other developers&#x20;

Tech is fast moving. For those who are passionate about tech, it's crucial to be continuously learning.&#x20;

TechTree makes it easier with companies sharing their latest projects, updates and announcements on their profiles. What better way to get updates and insights than from the very teams working on them?

### Be a pioneer of open source knowledge&#x20;

If you're working on technical problems, you have a wealth of knowledge that others will want to hear about. You may have just spent hours working on a project before coming up with a solution, and by sharing that solution on Techtree you could be saving others developers similar hours (possibly even days!)

Whether you're an old-hand at creating content or it's something you've never even thought to do, TechTree will support you on your journey to being an open-source knowledge pioneer.

### Help your fellow developer with their next adventure

Teamwork makes the dream work. Many hands make light work. A problem shared is a problem halved. There any many, many things to say about how coming together creates a better place for everyone.

TechTree gives you the chance to give back to the wider tech community through mentorship opportunities, contributing to meet-up events or even just writing a quick update on how you solved a technical issue. By giving a leg-up to a fellow developer, you could be helping them gain the skills they need to secure their next technical role.
