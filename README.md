### We've starting with Hiring Bounties ðŸ’°

We've started by focusing on a tricky problem, technical recruitment. Many scale-up tech companies - perhaps ones you've worked in - struggle to attract and keep great people. And - from our perspective as developers - we know how frustrating it can be to get an endless stream of emails / in-mail / phone-calls from recruiters offering roles at companies we've either never heard of or that they can't tell us the name of even.

That's why we've introduced the idea of hiring bounties ðŸ’°. The goal is to create a fair incentive structure that encourages us - the developers - to think of people we know and refer them into teams we're connected to. It's about a few highly personal recommendations rather than an endless stream of cold emails.

In our opinion, it's us, the developers - and our friends - in each dev team that are the best people best placed to attract developers to a team.&#x20;

It's our job at TechTree, to help companies understand this value and reward teams and their friends accordingly.

> **What's more, we want to make it easy for our community to donate some - or all of the rewards they earn - to open source projects and communities and publicly recognise those contributions over time. We are excited about doing the same with companies - publicly recognising the contributions teams and companies make over time**

### What's next?

Once we've established that [**hiring bounties**](how-it-works/how-bounties-work/hiring-bounties/) are a great way for teams to hire, and for developers to realise the value of their networks, we want to extend the concept of bounties and use it fuel a community where devs can learn, connect, share knowledge and team up.

The next step is bringing to life content creation on TechTree. If you're a content creator, your options for generating income from your content are currently super limited.

On TechTree, thanks to [**Creator rights**](how-it-works/how-bounties-work/creator-rights.md), everything you create, you own. Our platform links content - that helps create a successful bounty claims - to a claim payout. Meaning - in principle - the more you create and share knowledge the more you can I earn on TechTree.

### Evolving towards Web 3.0 at TechTree

One of the biggest problems of building a community that is based on bounties and rewards is counter-party risk - the risk of not getting paid!!&#x20;

We want everyone who takes the time to refer a friend to have confidence that there's money to pay them in the event their friend - or themselves - gets hired. And, that they don't need to discuss any of it with the hiring company.

What's more, we want to use our token (TechTree token) as a mechanism to support open source projects and communities in a seamless way. As a share of bounty, or regular on platform commitments from companies.

### Our vision

Is a social economic network built for devs and their teams (product managers, product designs, UX researchers, content designers and more - all are welcome).

We want to generalise the concept of bounties to be simply a _request for help_. Under this broader definition, we can imagine all manner of bounties: hiring bounties; speaking bounties; content bounties; Q\&A bounties; mentoring bounties and much more.

With a steady flow of value - all handled by our native token (TechTree Token) - fuelling the community. The _economy_ part of social economy network.

We'd like TechTree to become a place where developers can:

* find a great role
* earn from their network
* create content and earn from it
* learn from what others are sharing
* collaborate on side projects
* build meaningful relationships
* build a powerful personal profile based on merit and the strength of others trust in you (not just what brands you have on your CV)

For product teams, we want TechTree to be a place where teams:

* can be ambassadors for their teams incentivised with bounties
* share knowledge to build credibility and renown in the community
* build a community around themselves based on mentoring and knowledge sharing
