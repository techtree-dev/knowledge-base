![Learn more about each of these roles here](<../.gitbook/assets/Characters of TechTree (1).png>)

First, let's remember there are up to 4 [roles ](../roles-at-techtree/)(applicant, referrer, sharer, creator) and up to 4 [types of fees](pricing.md) in the claim chain for a bounty. This depends on the following cases:

### **Case 1 - Referrer and Applicant**

![](<../.gitbook/assets/Case 1 (1).png>)

Imagine the **Referrer** is on TechTree and sees the Senior Product Design role that the company Wayflyer has posted on the company Bounty Board with a bounty of **$10,000**ðŸ’°.  The Referrer thinks that their friend would be a great fit for this role. The **Referrer** sends their friend a tracked link for the role. The **Referrer** also decides to split the bounty 50:50 with their friend if the friend gets hired.

The friend, thinking they would be a good fit, applies for the job. The friend **** has become an **Applicant**. Let's say you loved how the **Applicant** interviews and hire the applicant. Wayflyer would then owe $11,500 in bounty fees.

**This is what the transaction should look like:**

| Player                            | Role            | Fee ðŸ’° |
| --------------------------------- | --------------- | ------ |
| The Person Referring Their Friend | Referrer        | $5,000 |
| The Friend Who Applied            | Applicant       | $5,000 |

### **Case 2 - Sharer, Referrer and Applicant**

Bob receives a referral link from Alice via WhatsApp and clicks follows it to the Wayflyer role on TechTree. **Bob** applies for the role and becomes an **Applicant**.

A short time later, Bob is invited to interview. Bob impresses the WayFlyer team and is hired. After 2 mths (60 days) has passed if Bob is still working with Wayflyer, then the amount owed by Wayflyer would be $12,500.
