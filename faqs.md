#### **What is TechTree?**

TechTree is the first socio-economic network for devs & their teams. A platform where people in the tech space can unlock the value of their networks, knowledge and data through hiring bounties. For more information, check out&#x20;

#### So I can get paid for referring people to roles?

Yes! For more details see [referring or applying](for-referrers-applicants/referring-or-applying.md).

#### **This seems too good to be true. What's the catch?**

The bounties you're seeing on TechTree are equivalent to the fees companies have historically being paying to technical recruiters.&#x20;

We're helping companies realise that the best ambassadors for their business are devs. And, the fees should be paid to you instead. It's that simple.

We make our money through subscriptions and an additional transaction fee charged to the company when we an application or referral comes from outside of a companies extended network.

#### How does TechTree make money?

TechTree receives a 15% transaction fee for each bounty paid.

#### Why should I use TechTree over a regular referral?

&#x20;TechTree allows you to refer people outside of your job, and allows you to refer people to organizations outside of where you are involved.

#### So I can only make money from referring?

No, you can make money 4 different ways. These are represented by 4 roles: Applicant, Referrer, Sharer, and Creator. For more information on roles see the [roles of TechTree](roles-at-techtree/)

#### Why share content on TechTree?

The TechTree platform is an easier way to share content. Even if you just share, if someone clicks your link you get money!

**What is a creator?**

A creator is a developer who has:

* "created" a bounty board on TechTree
* posted an article or video
* run or spoken at an event
* or created a splash page

Essentially, anything that a user has "created" on TechTree and belongs to that user. If a creators bounty board, article or event attracts a user to TechTree who then goes on to apply for a job or refer someone then that creator gets rewarded to. It's what's called [Creator rights](roles-at-techtree/creator-rights.md).

#### Why is TechTree relevant for creators?

Creators usually struggle with monetization. My allowing them to monetize thorugh their network they can actually get funds and help their community to get jobs and to monetize their content along with them.

#### **When do I get paid if either myself, or someone I refer, is hired?**

Payment will take place 90 days after the start date and once we have confirmed with the company that they're still employed.
