# Pricing for Talent Branches

The pricing structure for our VC Talent Branch has two payment scenarios:&#x20;

1. **If the candidate has been referred:**

* **Bounty:**

The bounty is paid to the referrer and based on the seniority/skill level of the position and is laid out in the table below:

#### Technical roles

| Seniority/Skill Level | Bounty  |
| --------------------- | ------- |
| Mid-level             | $6,000  |
| Senior-level          | $12,000 |
| C-level               | $18,000 |

#### Non-technical roles:

| Seniority/Skill Level | Bounty  |
| --------------------- | ------- |
| Mid-level             | $4,000  |
| Senior-level          | $8,000  |
| C-level               | $12,000 |

* **TechTree fee:**

The transaction fee is paid to TechTree and is 25% of the bounty.

## For Example

Let's say a super-talented candidate is referred to your VC talent branch who is a great fit for one of your portfolio companies.&#x20;

The candidate applies and becomes an **Applicant**. This applicant is interviewed for a senior-level position at the portfolio company that carries a $10,000 bounty. The interview process goes well and the candidate is hired. The individual who referred the applicant becomes a **Referrer** and is entitled to the $10,000 bounty. Let us assume the referrer decides to split the bounty 70:30 with the applicant who was hired.&#x20;

The total cost to the portfolio company will look like this:
