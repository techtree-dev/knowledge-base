## For Example

Let's say a super-talented candidate is referred to your VC talent branch who is a great fit for one of your portfolio companies.&#x20;

The candidate applies and becomes an **Applicant**. This applicant is interviewed for a senior-level position at the portfolio company that carries a $10,000 bounty. The interview process goes well and the candidate is hired. The individual who referred the applicant becomes a **Referrer** and is entitled to the $10,000 bounty. Let us assume the referrer decides to split the bounty 70:30 with the applicant who was hired.&#x20;

The total cost to the portfolio company will look like this:
