# For Users

Venture Capital firms are great at investing in innovative and interesting companies to help them grow and succeed. The brand equity that comes with a VC backing a company can not only help the company succeed, it can help the employees to build their personal brands to advance their careers. However, it can be difficult to know which company to apply to within the vast portfolio of your favorite Venture Capital firm. TechTree talent branches provide the perfect solution: simply apply to the Venture Capital firm's talent branch, and we will help to place you in the portfolio company that is the best fit.

### How to Use Talent Branches as a User

1. **Choose a VC**: Visit your favorite VC's talent branch dashboard to see generic roles that you can apply to or refer candidates to.
2. **Choose the role**: Pick which role or role(s) you want to explore.
3. **Refer/ Apply**: Click "Refer" or "Apply" and fill a short form. If you're refer, your friend will receive an email from TechTree, but you can also share the tracked referral link with them via whatsapp or similar.
4. **Matching**: If TechTree and the VC think you would be a good fit for the role, we will pair you with the portfolio company hiring for that role that you would be the best fit for.
