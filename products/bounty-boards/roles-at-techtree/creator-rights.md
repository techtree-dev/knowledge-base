# Creator rights

### What are Creator rights?

Creator rights are attached to anything on TechTree that belongs to a user. This could be:\
\- a personalized bounty board\
\- a personal links page \
\- any articles or content that you publish

**It only makes sense that you get rewarded for these community building activities.**

When another TechTree user lands on something that you created, we'll set a cookie with a short expiry in that user's browser. During that time, should this user submit a claim for a Bounty, whether itâ€™s applying for a job or referring a friend, you will be listed as the Creator that helped kickstart that Bounty claim chain. This means you could be rewarded as much as 25% of the quoted Bounty!

Any time you create or curate on TechTree, from articles and video posts to talks and Bounty boards, you unlock Creator rewards benefits.
