# Bounties

TechTree is a hiring marketplace that rewards users and their network for helping companies hire tech people through the use of bounties.

### **What are Bounties** ðŸ’° **?**

Bounties are `requests for help`. As an example, if a new startup needs to hire a CTO, then they can publish the role on TechTree and attach a bounty to it. The bounty is a request to the community for help in finding a good candidate for the role.

### What is a Bounty Board?

Bounty boards are where users can find available hiring bounties. The main TechTree bounty board displays all of the open bounties on TechTree. You also have the ability to add some filters to narrow the scope of your search. The main bounty board can be found [here](https://techtree.dev/bounties).

Bounty boards are also how companies can share their open positions and hiring bounties on TechTree. Each company will have its own job board that contains the open hiring bounties that the company is hiring for. These bounties are all amalgamated in the main bounty board on TechTree as well. Learn more about the process of creating a company bounty board in the For Companies section.

In addition to the main bounty board, TechTree allows users to create their own custom bounty boards. This bounty board comes with a tracked link that lets you get a share of any bounty filled if someone clicks your link and ends up getting hired! Learn more about how users can utilize bounties in the [For Users](../talent-branches/for-users.md) section.
