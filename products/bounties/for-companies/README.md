### **How to Post Your Open Roles To TechTree as a Company Hiring**

1. **Identify roles**: Tell us what roles you need help with. Examples of roles hired through us are back-end engineer, Ruby developer, senior product manager, etc.
2. **Set your bounty**: Set a bounty value of your choosing for each open role. This is a prize you reward people for helping you find someone good. See our [Pricing Page](pricing.md) for more info.
3. **Publish**: We publish your role and the bounty to TechTree.
4. **Promote**: We promote each role through our network of techies, communities, creators, etc.&#x20;

We also _strongly_ encourage you to share the posting with your broader network, especially your dev teams who can have their owned tracked links (which takes advantage of [Sharer rights](../roles-at-techtree/sharer-rights.md)) and their own bounty boards (which leverage [Creator rights](../roles-at-techtree/creator-rights.md)).

_**Conditions**_

* Anyone can submit a referral, and all referrals are bounty-eligible. Candidates can apply as themselves. We also have our own internal talent acquisition team who source for your company's roles.
* Referrers can decide how much of the bounty they would like to keep and how much they'd like to share with the candidate.
* The bounty is not due until your new hire starts.
* The amount you owe can be up to 50% more than the bounty quoted on the role as we have to account for [Sharer rights](../roles-at-techtree/sharer-rights.md) & [Creator rights](../roles-at-techtree/creator-rights.md) (as well as our 15% TechTree fee in the event that the hire is sourced from outside of your network\*\*).
* The bounty is refundable for 60 days, in case your new hire doesnâ€™t work out.
