### **Subscription Fee**

A subscription is required to post your company's open roles to TechTree. During the current beta phase, a subscription can be purchased for **FREE.** This grants you the ability to post an unlimited amount of bounties.&#x20;

After Techtree's Beta phase, the subscription fee will rise to Â£500 per month. Sign up now before the Beta ends to secure this massive saving.

### **Bounty Fee**

This fee is applicable when a user refers their connections to a job.&#x20;

A Referrer is the person who invites their connection to apply for an open position on TechTree. They are able to split 100% of the bounty fee between themselves and the applicant OR donate all or a portion of the bounty to a charity/opensource project of their choice.

### Creator Fee

This fee is only applicable if there is a Creator involved in the hiring chain.
