### **How to Use Bounty Boards as a Referrer or Applicant**

1. **Find bounties**: Go to [techtree.dev/bounties](https://techtree.dev/bounties) to see bounties or find bounties via a dev or dev teams bounty board.
2. **Choose the role**: Pick which role or role(s) you want to explore with your network. Do you have a friend or former colleague that sounds like a great fit for a role? Have you come across someone‚Äôs background or portfolio recently who‚Äôs a good match? See an opportunity that sounds too good to pass up for yourself?
3. **Refer/ Apply**: Click "Refer" or "Apply" and fill a short form. If you're refer, your friend will receive an email from TechTree, but you can also share the tracked referral link with them via whatsapp or similar.
4. **Activate**: You will receive an e-mail in order to activate and setup up your TechTree account. We'll be adding tracking to your account dashboard shortly so see the status of applications and referrals, as well as track any bounty claims that are connected to tracked links you've shared.
5. **Wait to get paid**: 90 days after your candidate starts on the job, you get paid the bounty. This is kind of the industry standard, right? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

You can make a **max of 10 referrals** on TechTree for starters. Want more? [Contact us](mailto:laurence@techtree.dev) about joining our [bounty hunters guild](https://techtree-dev.typeform.com/bountyguild).

### How to Use a Personal Bounty Board to Share Roles

1. Click the drop down arrow near your profile picture and click on "My bounty board"
2. Here you can add roles that you think are relevant to your network. Click the "Customize" button and click the check box to the left of any roles you would like to add to your personal bounty board. You can select from the available roles on the main TechTree bounty board.
3. Click the "Save" button towards the top to save these roles to your bounty board
4. You can now click the "Share" button for a custom tracked link to your bounty board to share with your network. Should anyone who follows your link apply and get hired, you can get paid a sharer fee of 10% of the bounty! For a fully worked example, look for the "Sharer" role in the link below üëá
