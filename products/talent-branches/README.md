# VC Talent Branches

As a VC, you hope that all your portfolio companies succeed. Without good employees, that becomes very difficult. That is where **TechTree Talent Branches** come in. TechTree talent branches enable VCs to channel the entirety of their talent network into their portfolio companies to find the best fit for each company. Using the brand power of your VC, you can have candidates apply to your VC broadly to be placed in a portfolio company.&#x20;

### How Does It Work?

The process of setting up a talent branch is simple. Working with TechTree, you will create a dashboard for your VC. Once your dashboard is setup, the process is as follows:

1. _A candidate is referred or can apply themselves to this Talent Branch only for your VC portfolio companies._
2. _The candidate accepts the referral and becomes visible for the portfolio companies of your VC._
3. _The portfolio companies reach out to the candidate and pitch their roles with job descriptions, remuneration, process details, etc._
4. _The candidate can express interest in the role and share the contact details to go into a hiring process._
5. _If the referred candidate is hired, the referrer gets the bounty :)_

### Setup and Promote Your Branch

After signing up with TechTree, you will have a dashboard for your VC that helps you leverage your branding power. The dashboard looks something like this:

Scrolling down the page, we can see some generic roles that people within your VC network and beyond can apply to or refer candidates to:

From here, you can review applicants and funnel them to the portfolio company&#x20;
