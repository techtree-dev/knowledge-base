# Roles at TechTree

When a Bounty claim is made, there can be as many as four different roles of people who can be rewarded:

![The 4 possible roles when a bounty claim is made](<../.gitbook/assets/Characters of TechTree (1).png>)

#### **1. Applicant**

The **person who is applying for the job**, need we say more? But we will anyway, whether you've been told about the job by someone or found it yourself, as long as you've hit that 'apply' button you're an applicant to us.

**2. Referrer**

A referrer is **the one who suggests the bounty** üí∞ **to the applicant**.&#x20;

They are people who know people. If you know someone who's a great fit for a bounty, all you need to do is share the tracked referral link with them. If they apply and are successfully hired, congrats! You and your friend get to share the bounty, you for referring them and them for getting a new job!

#### **3. Sharer**

**The one who generates and shares** a tracked TechTree **link that causes either the Referrer or the Applicant to join the platform**. You're a trendsetter. A pioneer of the next big thing. You've discovered TechTree and you want to share it with friends, colleagues and country-people.

When someone joins TechTree using the tracked link you shared, you'll receive a piece of any bounty they win. Just a little way we want to say 'thank you' for sharing TechTree with the world.&#x20;

#### **4. Creator**

**The one who creates something that directly leads to the Applicant submitting a claim on a Bounty**, for example the author of an article that the Applicant read before applying for a role.

The keyholders for unlocking tech knowledge potential. The ones who have taken the time to open source your knowledge, making people want to check out TechTree. It's only fair that we reward you for doing so.&#x20;
