# Our vision

> **Developers should be rewarded for the value of their networks, the content the create, and their promotion of our community**

### Our vision

We're building the first social economic network for devs & their teams. No spam. Own what you create. Support open source. A platform that helps devs & tech people unlock the value of their networks, knowledge and data. For us, bounties are the key - and we've started with hiring bounties.

### Why are we building TechTree?

We’re building TechTree because we believe it should be simple for people to help each other and get rewarded when their actions create value for others and organisations.

Our goal at TechTree is to create an environment in which: tech people can help each other through content, mentoring, events, and more, but also unlock the value of their network, knowledge, and data; and turn it into a meaningful source of income.

There are two key areas we're focused on:

* the budgets companies set aside for technical recruiters and agencies
* and Web 2.0 platforms that reach multi-billion dollar values on the back of their users need to self-express, create and share content&#x20;

### What's next?

Once we've established that [**hiring bounties**](how-it-works/how-bounties-work/hiring-bounties/) are a great way for teams to hire, and for developers to realise the value of their networks, we want to extend the concept of bounties and use it fuel a community where devs can learn, connect, share knowledge and team up.

The next step is bringing content creation to life on TechTree. If you're a content creator, your options for generating income from your content are currently super limited.

On TechTree, thanks to [**Creator rights**](how-it-works/how-bounties-work/creator-rights.md), everything you create, you own. Our platform links content - that helps create a successful bounty claims - to a claim payout. Meaning - in principle - the more you create and share knowledge the more you can earn on TechTree.

### The future

Hiring bounties and content bounties are just the beginning. We can envisage all manner of bounties funded by companies for all manner of activities, fuelling the community.

### How the TechTree community can support open source?

Tens of thousands of business worldwide rely on the code written by volunteers. This is not right, nor is it sustainable without issues cropping up.

We see an opportunity to help address this issue. For many developers, the reward of helping a friend find a great role is enough - for these people we want to give them a chance to donate some or all of their rewards to projects - and be recognised for their contribution. Our goal is to create a culture of giving founding on the egalitarian roots of software engineering.

What's more, we want to encourage companies and teams to set up regular donations to open source projects via TechTree. All of which can be cleanly and transparently facilitated by our Token (TechTree Token | TTT). See our [litepaper](litepaper.md) for more details.

We think we're well placed to promote that behaviour as we can celebrate and promote teams & companies that are contributing. Helping to support the open source community whilst building community and credibility around dev teams at the same time.

### What has inspired TechTree?

_Businesses with uncapped and transparent earning potential for creators. They’re aware that their success is made possible by the community and the network effects that they help drive._

Whilst there are a few community focused businesses and systems out there, these are our favourite three because they understand the important of rewarding creators and the community:

* Roblox
* Crypto ecosystems
* AirBnB

Pawel and James, our CEO and CTO, have spent a while being involved in businesses operating in the crypto space. This has influenced the thinking at TechTree, especially business models that emerged thanks to blockchain.
