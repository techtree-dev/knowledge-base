# Our philosophy

## TL;DR

> **Developers should be rewarded for the value of their networks, the content the create, and their promotion of the community**

### Why are we building TechTree?

We’re building TechTree because we believe that it should be easy for people to help each other and get properly rewarded for it - as their actions create value for other people and organisations.

#### **Because the way the internet works has gone bizarrely wrong.**

_70% of all online content is user generated but only 1% of the value created by it gets back to the people who’ve created it. Which isn’t fair._

It’s amazing to see how content created by users has exploded. It’s so much easier for people to both gain audiences and to find the content that best suits them and their needs.

But sadly the creators aren’t the ones reaping the benefits of their hard work. Certain hosting companies have turned them into commodities that suit their needs, rather than the creators' needs. This has created a big competitive moat.

These hosting companies have commercialised data and attention connected with ‘free’ user-generated content via a clickbait focused advertising model. Or worse, give access to user’s data to recruiters and salespeople who end up relentlessly spamming.

_Click based economy has had huge ramifications._

Clickbait promotion has led to content with emotive headlines with controversial opinions to the forefront. This displaces more in-depth, balanced, and well-researched content. This has resulted in users being pulled into content holes, and in worse case scenarios can foster the development of radicalised opinions.

_The real value that the biggest world businesses have isn’t the tech they’re working on but the content their users are creating and the interactions those creators are fostering._

We believe that users should get access to the value they’re creating. Simple. A developer job referral is worth between 20 and 30k USD. If you’re asking someone to do that for free, that’s essentially asking for a favour that’s worth the value of a good car.

All creators on hosting platforms should have unlimited ways to communicate with their fans and audience, and engage them in formats that best suit them.

#### **So the internet isn’t working. What’s TechTree’s solution?**

_TechTree is the platform where developers can help each other level up and get rewarded for doing so._

We’ve spoken with over 500 developers, 250+ communities and creators, over 100 companies, and 20+ VCs - not as investors, but as users. We have taken the time to fully understand what users need and to listen to their insights.

From this, we’re broken down the following key features:

**Content publishing and following**

TechTree users can create content in all formats, both asynchronous and synchronous to ensure that creators can express their knowledge in the most effective format. We also split audiences into two different types, followers and subscribers. Subscribers are those super-fans who are notified whenever that creator publishes something, prioritising and personalising feeds.

If there’s one thing we love at TechTree, it’s collaboration! Teamwork certainly makes the dreamwork and we want to make it as easy as possible. Any users can ‘lend’ another user their audience, using their network and reach to bring attention to someone who’s up and coming. Help fellow creators receive the spotlight you feel they deserve.

**Meaningful interactions**

When joining a platform, you naturally start to belong to various networks. At TechTree, we call them Guilds. We want to make the Guild experience as meaningful and intuitive as possible so you can start getting connected.

Say you’re a developer at Pennylane, because Sequoia is a Pennylane investor you’ll also be part of the Sequoia. You’ll be able to communicate with users who are in the same Guild as you, helping you to organically grow your network. You’ll also be able to communicate with mutual followers.

One of TechTree’s core goals is to help developers level up. It’s important to us to create a space that allows users to find mentors that best suit them. Whether it’s meeting other developers from around the world through VC Guilds to exchange ideas, learnings and knowledge, or through one of the 200 plus communities we’re partnered with. Ensuring that there are multiple ways to connect with others with varying tech interests means that you can find the mentor that helps you gain the experience you need to level up in the way that works best for you.

#### What has inspired TechTree?

_Businesses with uncapped and transparent earning potential for creators. They’re aware that their success is made possible to the community and the following network effects that they create._

Whilst there are a few community focused businesses and systems out there, these are our favourite three that we often refer to internally:

Roblox

* Clear collaboration between creators on the platform
* Content curation with an incredibly safe environment for users
* Fair revenue share and unlimited earning potential for creators
* Creators can collaborate with brands within the existing platform Internal currency

Crypto-ecosystems

* Incentive mechanisms that help early users to benefit from long term value growth
* Network effects naturally connected with them
* Naturally growing communities

Airbnb

* Publicly admitting that their product is not the platform, but the hosts and their properties
* Giving their hosts equity ahead of the IPO as a recognition for their importance in making the platform a success

Pawel and James, our CEO and CTO, have spent a while being involved in businesses operating in the crypto space. This has influenced the thinking at TechTree, especially business models that emerged thanks to blockchain.
