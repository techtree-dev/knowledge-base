# Vision and Philosophy

## TL;DR: developer's should be rewarded for the knowledge they share.

To put it simply. It's just what's fair, but we appreciate that you may like some more context.

### Our Vision

We want to create a place where the people who do the work are rewarded fairly. Whether it's referring someone for a role who is then hired to creating a piece of content that engages an audience, you've helped people out and no good deed should go unrewarded.&#x20;

### **Our Philosophy**

#### Why are we building TechTree? Because some things on the internet went seriously sideways

_70% of all content is the so-called “user-generated content” but only 1% of the value created in the internet comes back to users_

On one hand, it’s an amazing success! It’s fantastic to see how content created by users has exploded. On the other hand, several companies in the world - YouTube, Facebook, Google, LinkedIn, etc. persuaded everyone that content should be free. This has created one of the biggest competitive moats of all time.

At the same time, all these companies commercialised data and attention connected with that free user-generated content via “clickbait” focused advertising model (YouTube, Google, Facebook) or by giving straight access to users’ data to recruiters and salespeople (LinkedIn) who can relentlessly spam us.

_The “click-focused” economy is the worst thing that happened to humanity and democracy in the 21st century_

This model has been promoting content with emotive headlines, driving controversy at the same time displacing more in-depth, balanced, and well-researched content. It has led to many bad things some of which are following:&#x20;

* People are becoming more polarized on every dimension making it more difficult to have balanced arguments.&#x20;
* In politics, it has led to the emergence of super populist figures who got elected at the same time forcing their political enemies to chase votes and “air time” replicating these tactics.&#x20;
* It has made teenagers and young adults feel worse about themselves as they are continuously comparing themselves to the life of “social media influencers” who get enormous reach.

_The real value of the biggest businesses in the world - LinkedIn, Facebook, Google (YouTube) - is not the tech which is mostly focused on effectively giving access to users data and attention but content its users are creating, their data and the interactions between them._

We believe that users should get access to the value they’re creating:&#x20;

* One recommended developer is worth 20-30k USD, so when you’re asking someone to do that for free is like asking for a favor that’s worth the value of a good car.&#x20;
* YouTube content creators should be able to work directly with brands rather than get matched with whoever gives Google the most money but only receive less than 10% of that amount at the end.
* Creators on all these platforms should have unlimited ways to communicate with their fans and audience, and engage them in different formats

**FUN FACT:** LinkedIn Recruiter and Sales Navigator subscription has _a negative network effect_ - the more people that purchase these solutions the more spammed by them other users will be which will lead to a steadily lowering response rate.

#### What’s our solution&#x20;

_TechTree is a place where developers help each other level up and get rewarded while doing so._

Below is the breakdown of the key features that we believe make it possible. We have been working closely with users on getting these insights for almost two years:

We’ve spoken with 500+ developers, 250+ communities and creators, over 100 companies, and 20+ VCs (not as investors, but as users).

**Content publishing & following:**&#x20;

* We enable users on TechTree to create content in all formats:&#x20;
  * Asynchronous: video, text, audio&#x20;
  * Synchronous: video event, life event&#x20;
* We enable users on TechTree to have two kinds of audience:&#x20;
  * Followers&#x20;
  * Subscribers - if you’re subscribing to someone you get notification about everything they publish and you can prioritize it in your feed&#x20;
* We support collaboration:&#x20;
  * Any user can “lend” another user their audience using their popularity and social “klout” to bring attention to someone up and coming

**Meaningful interactions:**&#x20;

As a user, you naturally belong to various networks. We call them “Guilds”.&#x20;

* For example, if you’re a developer at Pennylane, you’re also part of Sequoia guild (who is a Pennylane investor) as well as several other VCs.&#x20;
* You can communicate with users who are part of the same guilds as you.&#x20;
* You can also communicate with users you’re mutually following&#x20;

You can find mentors & network similarly to the launchclub, but you can be way more specific:&#x20;

* For example, as DevOps in Series A business backed by Sequoia in France you can connect with a lot of DevOps from their other portfolio companies all around the world&#x20;
* You can exchange knowledge, learn from one another, but also help each other with network&#x20;
* The Bounty system - see below - makes it easy for people to get rewarded
* &#x20;When you connect with someone you can easily discover shared “Guilds” etc.&#x20;

You can give back to the broader community&#x20;

* TechTree is already connected with close to 200 communities, meetups, bloggers, etc. (almost half of these organizations represents various diversity-focused groups)&#x20;
* Over 50% of these communities require mentors, speakers, and people keen to “open-source” their knowledge&#x20;
* Our users can easily make themselves available as speakers or mentors and get matched/connected with these communities

**Getting rewarded for helping - Bounties**&#x20;

* TechTree is a platform where we transparently talk about the value connected with helping, and we make sure it comes back to users. We call these mechanisms Bounties.&#x20;
* Bounties could be set for anything - helping someone with a hire, finding a speaker, consultant, but also selling a product, helping to get paid subscribers for a newsletter or training etc.&#x20;
* Here’s an example of a recruitment “Bounty Board”

![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/1imXqetxorw0LJzf49cD-OOZAw3S3JBlWRgtHwvk-gAe\_x172J4rVPYX4YD-VnHEpTHCGtDfpc3VeXYCvURDNHHz6E9YwkbArk2FJwK3WTG2fM4fXpU7dXEooQrjzOMssYaxnwA8)

In this example, our user Sally has decided to put together a list of jobs at the companies she likes and share it with her network. Someone from this network named “James” has decided to share it. If anyone gets hired via referral made by this page everyone will receive a fee - Sally, James, and the person who has made the referral.

Additionally, the person who makes the referral (and gets the highest fee) can also share the fee between themselves, the person they’ve recommended, and a charity. The biggest referral fee we have paid out was over 30k USD.

**The odds of getting the reward**

TechTree enables an important network effect compared to the traditional referral programs:&#x20;

* If you recommend someone for a job in your company, you’re going to get the reward only if they get the job. Let’s say there is a 10% chance of it happening. The remaining 90% of your effort is worth zero value.&#x20;
* On TechTree when you recommend someone and they don’t get the job, they can still stay on the platform and over the course of their membership can do many things on TechTree that can result in a Bounty payment such as applying for 10 more jobs. That means that on TechTree you get an infinite amount of chances, each with a 10% chance of scoring the reward. If you have 10 shots with a 10% chance each, the chance of scoring at least once is 80%.

**Getting rewarded for helping creators and the entire TechTree - TechTree token**&#x20;

* To “share” and “like” the content on TechTree you need to “spend” TechTree token&#x20;
* Every time you do that, the creator will receive the TT token from your account and you’ll get the “creator” token&#x20;
* Users will receive TT in reward for the attention they “spend” on TechTree, data they share as well as the value they contribute&#x20;
* We believe this will make “likes” and “shares” more meaningful and it will help our creators to build true communities around themselves&#x20;
* Companies will also be able to become “patrons” of various creators (subject to their agreement) on a similar mechanism.

#### What inspired us?&#x20;

_Businesses with uncapped and transparent earning potential for creators where their success is possible thanks to a community-building around them and network effects that follow._

Roblox&#x20;

We like many things about it, but some of the most important ones are:&#x20;

* Collaboration between creators on the platform
* Content curation and the fact that it’s such a safe environment for users&#x20;
* Fair revenue share and unlimited earning potential for creators&#x20;
* How brands can collaborate with creators and exist in this ecosystem&#x20;
* Their internal currency&#x20;

Crypto ecosystems:&#x20;

* An incentive mechanism helping early users to benefit from the long term value growth&#x20;
* Network effects naturally connected with them&#x20;
* Transparency&#x20;
* Communities that naturally grow around them&#x20;

Airbnb&#x20;

* Publicly admitting that their product is not the platform, but the hosts and their properties. And giving their hosts equity ahead of the IPO as a recognition of that fact.

Pawel and James have spent a while being involved in businesses operating in the crypto space and the thinking behind TechTree has been influenced by the business models that emerged thanks to blockchain.

Things we’re watching closely right now are companies like:&#x20;

* Ramp Network&#x20;
* SoRare / NBA TopShots&#x20;
* Axie Infinity and play to earn trend&#x20;
* Mirror

#### Why are we focused on developers?&#x20;

_They’re the key natural resource enabling growth in the 21st century. It’s no longer oil or copper, it’s people who can code._

For us, developers are more than just a professional group. They have characteristics similar to commodities - their supply is inflexible. It’s impossible to increase the number of Python engineers with five plus years of experience overnight or even in several years. That creates a basis for some amazing supply/demand dynamics that we’re only starting to observe.

Here are some more precise reasons that made us focus on devs:

* (Most) developers are frustrated by the same things about big tech as we are + the fact that they’re constantly being spammed - they’re looking for an alternative.&#x20;
* They’re one of the few groups that has thought deeply about these issues for years now, but there have been very few solutions so far.&#x20;
* Developers are the most sought after professional group in the world, despite being relatively small (around 40 million) it has several unique characteristics:&#x20;
  * It’s fully “no border” - devs from anywhere in the world speak the same language and can work with companies anywhere in the world. It’s important in the context of supply/demand dynamics we’ve mentioned above&#x20;
  * There is a natural tagging system (tech stack, seniority, tech challenges, industries) making it very easy to find relevant content & connections
  * Devs all over the world are solving similar problems at the same time and can learn from each other - for example, blockchain etc.&#x20;
  * A lot of the problems they’re solving is company stage and resources specific -> if you’re a single DevOps in a Series A business you want to learn about solutions used by people who were exactly in your position as solutions from someone who has 10 DevOps people will rarely be applicable to you&#x20;
* Unlike people in other professional areas like sales, marketing, ops, recruitment etc. devs spend almost all of their time on individual contributions working individually - they have no time to build connections with people from outside of their organizations or even their teams&#x20;
  * They have the need for that as all other people, which is why online forums, blogs, and meetups in this space have been thriving since its dawn - for example, the IRC channels&#x20;
* There are several huge “buckets of money” looking to pay extraordinary fees for the attention of developers:
  * Recruitment - all companies in the world need developers now and they’re happy to pay 20-30% of the annual salary for the devs they hire to recruiters&#x20;
  * Dev Tools - it’s a sector that emerged in the last 15 years which has a market cap of over two trillion dollars -> more than the entire consumer goods industry (if you exclude Apple). The difference is that dev tools companies are targeting 40 million people and the consumer goods sector over two billion people.
