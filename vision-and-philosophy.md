### TL;DR: developer's should be rewarded for the knowledge they share.

To put it simply. It's just what's fair, but we appreciate that you may like some more context.

#### Our Vision

We want to create a place where the people who do the work are rewarded fairly. Whether it's referring someone for a role who is then hired to creating a piece of content that engages an audience, you've helped people out and no good deed should go unrewarded.&#x20;

#### **Our Philosophy**
