# Our philosophy

> **Developers should be rewarded for the value of their networks, the content the create, and their promotion of our community**

### Why are we building TechTree?

We’re building TechTree because we believe it should be simple for people to help each other and get rewarded when their actions create value for others and organisations.

A single referral could easily be worth over $30,000. Our goal at TechTree is to create an environment in which: tech people can help each other through content, mentoring, events, and more, but also unlock the value of their network, knowledge, and data; and turn it into a meaningful source of income.

There are two key areas we're focused on:

* the bucket of money set aside for technical recruiters
* and Web 2.0 platforms that reach multi-billion dollar values on the back of their users need to self-express, create and share content&#x20;

#### Let's start with technical recruitment

Companies are willing to pay tens of thousands of dollars to source and hire great engineers. Yet, the best source of engineers are the devs already on their teams. Mobilising these gatekeepers by incentivising them as equals to a technical recruiter is at the heart of what TechTree is about.

Companies are infinitely more likely to attract the right people when they're some form of personal connection - a friend - or trusted gatekeeper - an influencer, well-networked person or community leader - involved.

This - we believe - is how technical recruitment should be done. By technical people who know the industry and the challenges.

> **We believe that users should get access to the value they’re creating. Simple. A developer job referral is worth between $20K and $30K. If you’re asking someone to do that for free, that’s essentially asking for a favour that’s worth the value of a good car.**

#### Content creation

One other problem we're focused on is that nearly all online communities and social networks do not share value with their users. The creators who build the community rarely share in the success of the platforms. To us, this is a broken model.&#x20;

> _**70% of all online content is user generated but only 1% of the value created by it gets back to the people who’ve created it. This is not fair.**_

Platforms are typically using their creators' content to sell advertising or sell subscription to corporate clients. These hosting platforms have commercialised data and attention connected with ‘free’ user-generated content via a clickbait focused advertising model. Or worse, have given access to users data to recruiters and salespeople who end up relentlessly spamming.

Clickbait promotion has led to content with emotive headlines with controversial opinions to the forefront. This displaces more in-depth, balanced, and well-researched content. This has resulted in users being pulled into content holes, and in worse case scenarios can foster the development of radicalised opinions.

> **The real value that the biggest world businesses have isn’t the tech they’re working on but the content their users are creating and the interactions those creators are fostering.**&#x20;

Solving, this problem for content creators we believe will help TechTree to thrive as a community. The greater the community, the more bounties, the more value shared and the more positive outcomes for our members.

### How the TechTree community can support open source?

Tens of thousands of business worldwide rely on the code written by volunteers. This is not right, nor is it sustainable without issues cropping up.

We see an opportunity to help address this issue. For many developers, the reward of helping a friend find a great role is enough - for these people we want to give them a chance to donate some or all of their rewards to projects - and be recognised for their contribution. Our goal is to create a culture of giving founding on the egalitarian roots of software engineering.

What's more, we want to encourage companies and teams to set up regular donations to open source projects via TechTree. All of which can be cleanly and transparently facilitated by our Token (TechTree Token | TTT). See our [litepaper](litepaper.md) for more details.

We think we're well placed to promote that behaviour as we can celebrate and promote teams & companies that are contributing. Helping to support the open source community whilst building community and credibility around dev teams at the same time.

### What has inspired TechTree?

_Businesses with uncapped and transparent earning potential for creators. They’re aware that their success is made possible by the community and the network effects that they help drive._

Whilst there are a few community focused businesses and systems out there, these are our favourite three because they understand the important of rewarding creators and the community:

* Roblox
* Crypto ecosystems
* AirBnB

Pawel and James, our CEO and CTO, have spent a while being involved in businesses operating in the crypto space. This has influenced the thinking at TechTree, especially business models that emerged thanks to blockchain.
