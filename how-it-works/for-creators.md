You're an open-source knowledge hero. It doesn't matter if you're an experienced creator, still finding your feet or looking to get started. You've taken the noble mission to share your experiences, opening knowledge to all.

#### Open-source your knowledge

Youâ€™ve taken the time to share your knowledge with your fellow technical folk, and you should be rewarded for that. Soon you'll be able to publish your entire content portfolio on TechTree. Thatâ€™s everything from articles to podcasts to videos, even content you created for company blogs will be easily accessible from your profile.

#### Help others level-up

Itâ€™s not only through your content that youâ€™ll be able to help others. Right now on TechTree, youâ€™re able to refer developers who you think will be brilliant for a particular role. If they get hired, you get rewarded for doing a good deed, and have the option to split the Bounty reward with the applicant and a charity.

#### Unlock the potential of your network

Even if you donâ€™t have anyone in particular in mind for a role, you can curate your own job board using the roles open on the TechTree platform. By featuring jobs that require candidates to have the knowledge you create content around, youâ€™re giving applicants the opportunity to level themselves up, opening more doors for them and increasing your chances of getting rewarded for winning a Bounty. Everyone wins!
