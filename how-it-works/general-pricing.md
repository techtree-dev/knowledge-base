Here is some additional information on the fees:

### **Subscription Fee**

To start posting bounties we require you to sign up for a modest **Â£200 / mth** which gives you the ability to post and unlimited amount of bounties.

### Transaction Fee

If the hire comes from **inside your network**, there is no bounty fee (**Â£ 0**).

If the hire comes from **outside your network**, TechTree's fees are **15% of your proposed bounty**.&#x20;

We can track referrals to your dev teams and friends of the company via tracked link and associations in our database.

### Promotional fees

Techtree's promotional fees only come in place if there is a Sharer and/or a Creator involved.

A Sharer is the one who generates and shares a tracked TechTree link that causes either the Referrer or the Applicant to join the platform.

A Creator is the one who creates something that directly leads to the Applicant submitting a claim on a Bounty, i.e. the author of an article that the Applicant read before applying for a role.

Since we are all about distributing value for work, there is a compensation of 10% of the bounty amount for the Sharer and of 25% of the bounty for the creator. You can find examples on when this is applicable under [examples](how-bounties-work/hiring-bounties/examples.md).



### Picking a Bounty Price

If youâ€™re posting a specific role for a bounty, how you price it is totally up to you.\
\
Recruiting is a hard problem - this price should reflect what you feel you need to spend, in order to get this hard problem solved by someone who can help you.
