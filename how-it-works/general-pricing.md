# General pricing

### Overview

To summarize and make this 100% transparent. Many of our calculations are based on the [bounties ](how-bounties-work/)and there are two types of scenarios for companies using our services:

### **1. Hiring through your network:**

In the case you put out a bounty and the person you end up hiring comes from your own network:

| Type             | Formula               | Frequency                          | Paid to  |
| ---------------- | --------------------- | ---------------------------------- | -------- |
| Subscription Fee | **Â£200**              | Monthly, after the first two weeks | Techtree |
| Transaction Fee  | **Â£0**                | Once off                           | Techtree |
| Sharer Fee       | 10% of the bounty  ðŸ’° | Once off                           | Sharer   |
| Creator Fee      | 25% of the bounty  ðŸ’° | Once off                           | Creator  |

### **2. Hiring through TechTree network:**

In the case you put out a bounty and the person you end up hiring comes from Techtree's network:

| Type             | Formula               | Frequency                          | Paid to  |
| ---------------- | --------------------- | ---------------------------------- | -------- |
| Subscription Fee | **Â£200**              | Monthly, after the first two weeks | Techtree |
| Transaction Fee  | 15% of the bounty  ðŸ’° | Once off                           | Techtree |
| Sharer Fee       | 10% of the bounty  ðŸ’° | Once off                           | Sharer   |
| Creator Fee      | 25% of the bounty  ðŸ’° | Once off                           | Creator  |



Here is some additional information on the fees:

### **Subscription Fee**

To start posting bounties we require you to sign up for a modest **Â£200 / mth** (during the current beta phase) which gives you the ability to post and unlimited amount of bounties.&#x20;

After Techtree's Beta phase the subscription fee will be Â£500 per month. The Beta phase duration is still to be defined as we are an early stage startup.

### Transaction Fee

We also should get remunerated for our efforts in the case we are successful so:

* If the hire comes from **inside your network**, there is no bounty fee (**Â£ 0**).
* If the hire comes from **outside your network**, TechTree's fees are **15% of the bounty**.&#x20;

We can track referrals to your dev teams and friends of the company via tracked link and associations in our database. You can find examples on when this is applicable under [examples](how-bounties-work/hiring-bounties/examples.md).

### Sharer Fee

This fee only comes in place if there is a Sharer involved in the hiring chain.

A Sharer is the one who generates and shares a tracked TechTree link that causes either the Referrer or the Applicant to join the platform.

You can find examples on when this is applicable under [examples](how-bounties-work/hiring-bounties/examples.md).

### Creator Fee

This fee only comes in place if there is a Creator involved in the hiring chain.

A Creator is the one who creates something that directly leads to the Applicant submitting a claim on a Bounty, i.e. the author of an article that the Applicant read before applying for a role.

You can find examples on when this is applicable under [examples](how-bounties-work/hiring-bounties/examples.md).

### Picking a Bounty Price

If youâ€™re posting a specific role for a bounty, how you price it is totally up to you.\
\
Recruiting is a hard problem - this price should reflect what you feel you need to spend, in order to get this hard problem solved by someone who can help you.
