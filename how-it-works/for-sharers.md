We’d be nowhere without you, Sharer. You’re the one who helps out others when it comes to the latest trends and updates. Without you, we’d all still be wearing skinny jeans. You lift up others by sharing resources and content you know will benefit them. We want to reward you for this altruistic behavior because we recognise that we’d be seriously uncool without you.

#### Help friends level up&#x20;

Whenever you invite a friend to TechTree, that friend is forever connected to you. Whenever your friend wins a Bounty, a portion of that will be rewarded to you as a ‘thank you’ for introducing your friend to the TechTree adventure.

What a great way to celebrate friendship!

#### Support the Creators who support you&#x20;

You help the Creators you love gain engagement and views on the knowledge they’ve curated by sharing the content with those who you think need to see it.

By supporting Creators in this way, you help the community grow and ensure that the open-source knowledge movement really is open to all.

#### Get rewarded for boosting others&#x20;

Through sharing referral links, knowledge from Creators and invites to join TechTree, you’re a triple threat when it comes to helping others level up.

Making sure you get rewarded is our way of making sure you get to level up too.
