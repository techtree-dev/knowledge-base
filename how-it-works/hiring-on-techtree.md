# Hiring on TechTree

TechTree is a hiring marketplace that rewards developers and their network with the value that would be traditional paid to a technical recruiter.

_**Process for companies hiring**_

1. **Identify roles**: Tell us what roles you need help with. Examples of roles hired through us are: back-end engineer, Ruby...
2. **Budget for the role**: Set a bounty for each role as % of annual salary or day rate across all roles.\* See our [Pricing Page](../pricing/pricing-hiring-teams.md) for more info.
3. **Publish**: We publish your role and the bounty to our hiring bounty boards.
4. **Promote**: We promote each role to targeted audiences. We use the TechTree network for general roles, where we already trust people to refer high-caliber talent.

We also _strongly_ encourage you to share the posting with your broader network especially your dev teams who can have their owned tracked links (which takes advantage of [Sharer rights](how-bounties-work/sharer-rights.md)) and their own bounty boards (which leverages [Creator rights](how-bounties-work/creator-rights.md)).

_**Conditions**_

* Anyone can submit a referral, and all are bounty-eligible. Candidates can apply as themselves. We also have our own internal talent acquisition team who source for your roles.
* Referrers can decide how much of the bounty they would like to keep and how much they'd like to share with the candidate.
* We screen candidates first, and only recommend to you those who we think are a good fit.
* You only owe the bounty when your new hire starts.
* The amount you owe can be up to 50% more than the bounty quoted on the role as we have to account for [Sharer rights](how-bounties-work/sharer-rights.md) & [Creator rights](how-bounties-work/creator-rights.md) (as well as our 15% TechTree fee in the event that the hire is sourced from outside of your network\*\*.
* The bounty is refundable for 60 days, in case your new hire doesnâ€™t work out.

\* This is what bounty hunters will see on our board, and what they will be paid (in full) if they refer someone whom you hire. **TechTree fees are 15% of the posted bounty** for running the marketplace and vetting candidates.

\*\* Our fee is only payable when a hire comes via a bounty board or link that is not connected to you or your network. For example, if the hire comes via a bounty belonging to one our community partners.\
