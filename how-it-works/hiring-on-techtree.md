# Hiring on TechTree

1. Tell us what roles you need help with.
2. Set a bounty for each role or set a % of annual salary or day rate across all roles.\* See our [Pricing Page](../pricing/pricing-hiring-teams.md) for more info.
3. We publish your role and the bounty to our hiring bounty boards.
4. We promote each role to targeted audiences. We use the TechTree network for general roles, where we already trust people to refer high-caliber talent. We also _strongly_ encourage you to share the posting with your broader network especially your dev teams who can have their owned tracked links (which takes advantage of [Sharer rights](how-bounties-work/sharer-rights.md)) and their own bounty boards (which leverages [Creator rights](how-bounties-work/creator-rights.md)).
5. Anyone can submit a referral, and all are bounty-eligible. Candidates can apply as themselves. We also have our own internal talent acquisition team who source for your roles.
6. Referrers can decide how much of the bounty they would like to keep and how much they'd like to share with the candidate.
7. We screen candidates first, and only recommend to you those who we think are a good fit.
8. You only owe the bounty when your new hire starts.
9. The amount you owe can be up to 50% more than the bounty quoted on the role as we have to account for Sharer rights & Creator rights (as well as our 15% TechTree fee in the event that the hire is sourced from outside of your network\*\*.
10. The bounty is refundable for 60 days, in case your new hire doesnâ€™t work out.

\* This is what bounty hunters will see on our board, and what they will be paid (in full) if they refer someone whom you hire. **TechTree fees are 15% of the posted bounty** for running the marketplace and vetting candidates.

\*\* Our fee is only payable when a hire comes via a bounty board or link that is not connected to you or your network. For example, if the hire comes via a bounty belonging to one our community partners.\
