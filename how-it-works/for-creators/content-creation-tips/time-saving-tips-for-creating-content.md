# Time saving tips for creating content

### Using what you already have&#x20;

You’d be surprised how much potential content you are currently creating! Memos for weekly check ins and standups, answering questions on Slack, StackOverflow and other forums, documentation note taking - these are all examples of everyday tasks you’re already doing that can be easily transformed into content!

#### Memos

Memos are a great record to read back on to see your thought process throughout a project, including challenges and how you overcame them. You’d be surprised that by compiling them together, tidying them up a little as you go, can result in an article that features a lot of learning points and knowledge.

#### Forum answers&#x20;

Answering questions on forums like StackOverflow and community servers can give great insight into what type of content you should be creating. If you find you’re answering the same sort of questions over and over again, take that as a sign that there’s not enough information about that topic out there! Much like with memos, taking the time to put your answers together could be the beginnings of an engaging article. Alternatively, why not record a quick video explaining how to solve the problem including an explanation of how you arrived at the solution. You already know that there’s an audience for it and you've already written down solutions!

#### Documentation notes&#x20;

Documentation notes can be utilised in a very similar way to memos. The difference is that documentation notes will have more details on a specific project that you’ve been working on. When creating content around documentation notes, it’s worth checking that you’re ok to publicly talk about the project before getting started.

### It’s always ok to revisit&#x20;

You don’t need to be finished with a project before you start creating content around it. In fact, having to explain what you’re doing and why in a way people outside the project can understand is a really good exercise in solidifying your own knowledge.

Content created as you go through your journey in the project can give deeper insight into your thought process each step of the way. This can be more valuable to other developers as they’ll have access more to why you’re doing what you’re doing rather than just the what.

Once you’ve finished the project, you can always publish a follow up piece of content. This could create a nice comparison with your previous content as it shows how the project and your thinking has progressed.

### Write in your own voice&#x20;

A written piece that reads in a more natural, understandable voice is more engaging than a sterile or over thought article. An easy hack for this is to record yourself talking about the topic you want to create content around and transcribe what you’ve said. You could even do it with another person who doesn’t know the topic to encourage you to outline all the important points without assuming that they already know.

After you’ve transcribed the recording, you might find you have notes that could become a talk or that with some tidying the transcription could become an article.
