**Help your developer community flourish.**

You and your team are working on some amazing things, and in the process youâ€™re solving technical problems. Get outside developers excited and invested in what youâ€™re creating using your team's domain expertise by sharing these findings. Show your team off!

**Create the community of you.**

By supporting your engineering team through open-sourcing their knowledge not only are you developing their beyond code skills, but also engaging potential future teammates with your teamâ€™s creative technical problem solving. Donâ€™t tell people who you are, show people who you are.

**Engage, partner, grow.**

Collaborate with existing tech communities to further one another's knowledge whilst also helping the tech causes that matter the most to you. By learning and sharing as part of the tech ecosystem, you're helping build an ethos of open-source knowledge where solutions are celebrated not hidden.
