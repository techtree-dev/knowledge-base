# Creator rights

### What is a Creator?

Creators on TechTree are any users that have published content, setup a bounty board, create their personal links page.

### What are Creator rights?

Creator rights are attached to anything on TechTree that belongs to a user. This could be:\
\- a personalised bounty board\
\- personal links page \
\- any articles or content you publish

**It only makes sense that you get rewarded for doing so.**

When another TechTree user lands on something you created, we'll set a cookie with a short expiry in that user's browser. During that time, should they submit a claim for a Bounty, whether it’s applying for a job or referring a friend, you’ll be listed as the Creator that helped kickstart that Bounty claim chain. This means you could be rewarded as much as 25% of the quoted Bounty!

Any time you create or curate on TechTree, from articles and video posts to talks and Bounty boards, you unlock Creator rewards benefits.

### The Bounty claim chain

Bounties are available for a number of things on TechTree. At the moment, the most common is a hiring Bounty. When a Bounty claim is made, there can be as many as four different people who can be rewarded:

**The Applicant** - the one who is applying to win claim a Bounty&#x20;

**The Referrer** - the one who suggests the Applicant should submit for a Bounty.&#x20;

**The Creator** - the one who creates something that directly leads to the Applicant submitting a claim on a Bounty, for example the author of an article that the Applicant read before applying for a role.&#x20;

**The Sharer** - the one who generates and shares a tracked TechTree link that causes either the Referrer or the Applicant to join the platform.
