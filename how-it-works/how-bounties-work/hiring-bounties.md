# Hiring Bounties ðŸ’°

Hiring bounties create a fair incentive structure that encourages users to refer people they know into teams we are connected to.

There are up to four different [types of roles](../../roles-at-techtree/) in hiring bounties: referrer, applicant, sharer and creator. Here is a simple example:

Imagine, Alice has seen a job on a Bounty Board (with a bounty of **$10,000**) on TechTree that she thinks her friend, Bob would be great for. **Alice** becomes a **Referrer** and sends Bob a tracked link for the role. Alice also decides to split the bounty 50:50 with Bob.

Bob thinks he would be a great fit and applies. **Bob** has become an **Applicant**. Because Bob and the role are a match made in Heaven, Bob is hired. Alice and Bob split the bounty between them because this type of friendship should be rewarded!

This is what the transaction should look like:

| Player | Role      | Reward ðŸ’° |
| ------ | --------- | --------- |
| Alice  | Referrer  | $5,000    |
| Bob    | Applicant | $5,000    |
