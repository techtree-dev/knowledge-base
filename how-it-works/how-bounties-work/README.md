# How Bounties work

### **What are Bounties** ðŸ’° **?**

Bounties are `requests for help`. As an example, if a new startup needs to hire a CTO, then they can publish the role on TechTree and attach a bounty to it. The bounty is a request to the community for help in finding a good candidate for the role.

### **What types of Bounties are possible?**

Currently, TechTree allows for [hiring bounties](hiring-bounties/). We're excited about the possibility of bounties and can see them being extended to all manner of areas, not just hiring. For example:

* Content Bounties - Requests for help creating content for companies technical blog
* Speaker Bounties - Requests for help filling a speaker slot at an upcoming event
* Mentor Bounties - Requests for help in finding great mentors for a community
* Bug Bounties - Requests for help in finding bugs/security flaws in codebases
* And much more...

Let's look at the current type of bounties available:

{% content-ref url="hiring-bounties/" %}
[hiring-bounties](hiring-bounties/)
{% endcontent-ref %}
