# Roles within the Hiring Bounties

**Referrer**

Referrers are the **people who know people**. If you know someone who's a great fit for a bounty, all you need to do is share the tracked referral link with them. If they apply and are successfully hired, congrats! You and your friend get to share the bounty, you for referring them and them for getting a new job!

#### **Applicant**

The **person who is applying for the job**, need we say more? But we will anyway, whether you've been told about the job by someone or found it yourself, as long as you've hit that 'apply' button you're an applicant to us. If you’re successful in your application, you’ll win part of or a full bounty, depending on how you found out about the role.

#### **Sharer**

You're a **trendsetter**. A pioneer of the next big thing. You've discovered TechTree and you want to share it with friends, colleagues and country-people. When someone joins TechTree using the tracked link you shared, you'll receive a piece of any bounty they win. Just a little way we want to say 'thank you' for sharing TechTree with the world. Here are your rights:

{% endcontent-ref %}

#### **Creator (coming soon)**

The keyholders for unlocking tech knowledge potential. The ones who have taken the time to open source your knowledge, making people want to check out TechTree. It's only fair that we reward you for doing so. Here are your rights:
