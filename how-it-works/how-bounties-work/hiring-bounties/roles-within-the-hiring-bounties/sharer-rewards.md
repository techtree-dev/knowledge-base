# Sharer rights

TechTree is the user-owned social network built on the idea that any action that grows the community should be rewarded.&#x20;

**When you create a tracked link, that link will forever be connected to you.**&#x20;

By generating a tracked link and sharing it, you help the TechTree community grow. When someone joins the platform through your tracked link, you get rewarded too whenever they win a Bounty.

### The Bounty claim chain

Bounties are available for a number of things on TechTree. At the moment, the most common is a Hiring Bounty. When a Bounty claim is made, there can be as many as four different people who can be rewarded:

* **The Applicant** - the one who is applying to win claim a Bounty.
* **The Referrer** - the one who suggests the Applicant should submit for a Bounty.&#x20;
* **The Creator** - the one who creates something that directly leads to the Applicant submitting a claim on a Bounty, for example the author of an article that the Applicant read before applying for a role.&#x20;
* **The Sharer** - the one who generates and shares a tracked TechTree link that causes either the Referrer or the Applicant to join the platform.

**The more engaging tracked links that you generate and share, the more likely** you are to be **rewarded** for helping the TechTree community grow.
