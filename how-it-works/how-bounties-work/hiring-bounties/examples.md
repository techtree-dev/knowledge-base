# Examples

First, let's remember there are up to 4 roles (applicant, referrer, sharer, creator) in the claim chain for a bounty. There are different cases for their interactions, we summarized the main ones here:&#x20;

**Case 1 - Referrer and Applicant**

Imagine, Alice has seen a job on a Bounty Board (with a bounty of **$10,000**) on TechTree that she thinks her friend, Bob would be great for. **Alice** becomes a **Referrer** and sends Bob a tracked link for the role. Alice also decides to split the bounty 50:50 with Bob.

Bob thinks the role is right up their street and applies. **Bob** has become an **Applicant**. Because Bob and the role are a match made in Heaven, Bob is hired. Alice and Bob split the bounty between them because this type of friendship should be rewarded!

This is what the transaction should look like:

| Player   | Role      | Reward 💰 |
| -------- | --------- | --------- |
| Alice    | Referrer  | $5,000    |
| Bob      | Applicant | $5,000    |
| TechTree | Fee\*\*   | $1,500    |

\*\*This fee is only payable if Alice is not connected with the Hiring Company.



**Case 2 - Sharer, Referrer and Applicant**

Charlie is looking for a role for himself on Techtree. However, he finds a super interesting role at WayFlyer that could be good for anyone in his network, so he clicks share which generates a personalised tracked link for Charlie that points at the role he wants to share. **Charlie** has become a **Sharer**.

Charlie shares the link with his twitter audience and Alice follows it. Alice sees a role at WayFlyer with a $10,000 bounty. Alice knows Wayflyer, and Alice knows her friend Bob (who is a product designer) is looking for a new gig so she refers Bob. **Alice** has become a **Referrer**.&#x20;

Bob receives a referral link from Alice via WhatsApp and clicks follows it to the Wayflyer role on TechTree. **Bob** applies for the role and becomes an **Applicant**.

A short time later, Bob is invited to interview. Impresses the WayFlyer team and is hired. After 2 mths (60 days) has passed if Bob is still working with Wayflyer the full rewards will be distributed to all claimants.

**The Workings**

| Player   | Role      | Reward 💰 |
| -------- | --------- | --------- |
| Alice    | Referrer  | $5,000    |
| Bob      | Applicant | $5,000    |
| Charlie  | Sharer    | $1,000    |
| TechTree | Fee\*\*   | $1,500    |

\*\*This fee is only payable if Alice is not connected with the Hiring Company.



**Case 3 - Creator, Sharer, Referrer and Applicant**

Satoshi Nakamoto joins TechTree and posts an article about cryptography. **Satoshi** has become a **Creator**.

Charlie follows Satoshi and sees his article in his feed. Charlie clicks share which generates a personalised tracked link for Charlie that points at Satoshi's article. **Charlie** has become a **Sharer**.

Charlie shares the link with Alice who follows it. Whilst Alice is reading Satoshi's article she sees a role at WayFlyer with a $10,000 bounty. Alice knows Wayflyer, and Alice knows her friend Bob (who is a product designer) is looking for a new gig so she refers Bob. **Alice** has become a **Referrer**.&#x20;

Bob receives a referral link from Alice via WhatsApp and clicks follows it to the Wayflyer role on TechTree. **Bob** applies for the role and becomes an **Applicant**.

A short time later, Bob is invited to interview. Impresses the WayFlyer team and is hired. After 2 mths (60 days) has passed if Bob is still working with Wayflyer the full rewards will be distributed to all claimants.
