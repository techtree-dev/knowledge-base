All adventures are better with a party, and we salute you Community Leader who makes it possible. Weâ€™ll help you access top engineers at top tech companies who are willing to contribute their knowledge to your community and support you however you want your community to grow.

**Access the engineers that are creating the tech your community is excited about.**

Youâ€™ve created a community meaning you directly contribute to the progression of accessible, open source knowledge throughout tech. Youâ€™re not doing this for money or for fame, but because you love tech and want to make sure that everyone can learn about and celebrate it.

**Focus on whatâ€™s important.**

Community members, future speakers, and sponsors can all be engaged and engage with your community from the one site, letting you focus on the important stuff. Help members of your community become champions, giving them more tools to support the community that supported them.

**Open source means open doors.**

Our mission is to ensure that companies add value to your community by being good actors sharing knowledge through collaborative events, mentorship and access to their experts. Open doors to VC-backed companies with unicorn level tech who want to share their findings with your community.
