## What we share

Every week, we'll share with you a short, sharp highlight of the latest or top jobs with their Bounties from the companies that are hiring on TechTree. We'll remind you to either apply for the roles yourself or refer someone from your network to be in for the chance of winning the Bounty!

Here's a snippet of how it looks:
