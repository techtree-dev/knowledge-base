## Executive summary

TechTree token (TTT) is powering a new generation of professional social network. One that is recognizing that its users are the product and the tech supporting it is the commodity.

Companies like YouTube, Facebook and LinkedIn are successful because their users are:

* Posting content
* Interacting with content
* Sharing content with others
* Enabling these companies to use their data

However, users rarely see any benefit for their platform creating actions beyond any social equity accrued. Rarely, users receive a small fraction of the value they create but even this is unusual.

TTT is addressing that on two levels:

1. Creating a transparent system rewarding users who help to build TechTree by:

* Sharing. Sharers help grow the platform and the reputation of the community and will be rewarded and treated like an owner.
* Creating. Creators who create content that is connected to a revenue generating an event (a bounty being claimed - see bounties) will see be reward.
* Rewarding technical not popular content. The mechanics of TechTree - thanks to bounties - uniquely incentivise for the creation of a highly technical niche content because potential readers are highly likely to be very sought after developers and therefore may be connected with very large bounty events.

2\. Enabling users to "invest" in Creators they like to help them grow and also to be a part of their success.

* Instead of worthless likes, you can use your TTT to money like or money share content you like → this will financially benefit the Creator and enable you to participate in his value growth

Our vision is to create a place that is truly rewarding for people sharing valuable knowledge and content by creating a new generation of economic incentive system leading to creation of a metaverse in which such creators can create engaged communities around themselves and get access to significant income for both themselves and their fans by doing what they love.

**Benefits for Algorand ecosystem**

We believe that TTT can help Algorand and other projects in its ecosystem to massively scale adoption and awareness among developers all over the world. This tackles some of the biggest calling challenges that any protocol at this stage has which is its recognition and reputation among developers.

It would also make it first of its kind social networks in the developer ecosystem, with a very strong incentive for all its users, which could increase Algorand popularity among other teams looking to disrupt this space.

## Core team

TechTree team is 15 people full time people strong already.

**Pawel Tomczuk | CEO & co-founder**

Entrepreneur - has exited his first business to Publicis Groupe as approx. 70 people strong team in 2011.

## Problem description

At TechTree we believe that most of the highly valuable content on the internet is created by individuals - we often call them Creators these days. Unfortunately, the platforms they use to publish their content - Medium, Youtube, Apple Podcasts, or social networks - are not sharing any value with them (in some cases a very small fraction). We think that’s seriously wrong and we want to change it.

These content platforms and social networks are among the fastest-growing businesses and most profitable companies in the world.

> **They have created a toxic internet model based on clicks, which contributes to the spread of hate, misinformation and controversial headlines and limited space for meritocratic debate, in-depth arguments and knowledge sharing.**

The majority of their revenue comes from:

* Advertising (aka selling their users attention - Google, Facebook)
* Paid content (aka selling content created by their users - StackOverflow, Medium)
* Selling data created by users (e.g LinkedIn).

These platforms claim that it is a fair value exchange because their product is free and has huge utility value for their users. However, the logic behind these fees is completely opaque and discretionary and there is zero transparency around it.

Also as elaborated later in this document none of those platforms recognize that they're in fact "made by their users" - there is no long-term value share that would enable users to participate in the value they're creating by being active on these platforms.

TechTree aims to offer robust and transparent incentives for all contributors to its ecosystem on both of these levels:

* Short term - recognize users who are helping in revenue creation via transparent revenue share that happens always when the value is created.
* Long term - recognize that by using our platform users are helping its value to grow and enable mechanisms of sharing the value with them.

### Where developers “spend” their attention

The top places where developers spend their time-consuming content are StackOverflow, Reddit, Youtube and [Medium.com](http://medium.com). All of these places “use” developers not only to create content but also to rate it and increase the content & platform’s visibility. None of these platforms share revenues with their users in a meaningful way.

### How valuable is developers' attention?

The attention of developers captured by Creators is extremely valuable. Content created by engineers in the format of blogs, Youtube videos, podcasts or Meet-ups is highly engaging all over the world.

To think about how valuable this audience is it's worth to look at three groups who are desperate to attract developers' attention:

**1) Developer tools - approx. 2trn market cap - MongoDB / AWS / GCP / Kubernetes / Firebase and many more**

![](<.gitbook/assets/image 2.png>)

**2) Growth tech companies (Series B+) - Hopin / Personio / Klarna / Citymapper and many more.**

Just in 2020 the total amount of venture funding exceeded 300 bn USD ([Crunchbase](https://news.crunchbase.com/news/global-2020-funding-and-exit/)) and the main allocation of the funds is growing engineering teams.

**3) Educators - Bootcamps, Creators on Coursera and Udemy**

![](<.gitbook/assets/image 4.png>)

### The problems we're solving

**Developer Tools & Growth Tech Companies**

Both Developer Tools & Growth Tech Companies need to **attract** **developers' attention**. What they aim to do with that attention differs but the need to attract developer's attention is consistent. It's a crowded market with few marketing channels so many successful companies like Snyk are building their own communities and have invested in creating their own channels.

**Communities, Meet-ups & Creators**

Communities, Meet-ups & Creators need to **keep Developers' attention** by constantly providing engaging content to their follows and members.

💡 A natural progression for Developer Tools & Growth Tech Companies who have successfully attracting Developers' attention is to focus on how to keep it. And that's where TechTree can help Developer Tools & Growth Tech Companies to become communities. :bulb:

## Solution approach

### Competitive landscape

In the last decade or so there have been several successful businesses enabling Creators to get paid for their content. However they've been flawed and benefited from lack of alternative rather than being loved by Creators.

#### Education

The vertical which is most established here is “education” with the likes of Coursera, Udemy and many others - it’s of course not developer-specific, however it includes quite a lot of tech courses.

Problems for Creators:

* Platforms like Udemy often take as much as 50% of the fees generated from content
* These platforms offer poor experience for users, which results in a very low ratio of finished courses
* These platforms don't help Creators to build a closer, multi-touch point relationship with their users, which would make it easier for them build a strong brand and keep followers engaged long term (community is key to long term engagement)

#### Payment for access

One of the most successful businesses helping content Creators to earn money has been Patreon. It’s a generalist platform that has enabled payments to people you like and follow (artists, podcasters etc.) usually in exchange for special treatment - like access to community, live events or other forms of interaction / extra content that are not available to “non paying users”.

#### Payment for content

A business that became popular in the last few years is Substack - which enables authors of written content distributed in the form of a newsletter to get paid for access to special content.

#### Payment for attention

There are a number of businesses, none of which is widely known, that enable Creators (for example Instagram Influencers) to get paid by brands for posting content like photos featuring products from these brands or other marketing elements of their strategy like hashtags. The payment is usually automatically calculated on the basis of reach and engagement.

#### Summary

All of these models are generalistic (not developer specific) and don’t recognize the long term value that their users create by using these platforms. At TechTree we’re obsessed with creating a model that would not only reward users for the exchange of value in the short term but also recognize their influence and ownership of the platform in the long run.

To use an example, when an artist decides to post a piece of art on an online marketplace and then he shares it via his social channels, a typical business would enter into a relationship that only recognizes the value exchange when the art piece is sold via the platform. We believe that the fact that the artist shared his art piece on the platform (the artist is a Creator) and promoted it via his social media channels (the artist is a Sharer) deserves recognition and an adequate remuneration for both activities.

#### Long term remuneration examples

There are some companies already, who are making efforts to reflect the long-term value created by Creators. Such an approach can be observed in few businesses outside of crypto. It’s most commonly connected with ownership. Here are some examples that can be observed:

* Airbnb - gave shares to their hosts ahead of Airbnb
* Roblox - unlimited monetization for their Creators with a transparent revenue share

What TechTree believes is a fair value share?

TechTree believes that every user can have three roles in our social marketplace - each of them creating a different value - both short term and long term:

## Detailed Technical Plan and statement of work

### How TechTree Token (TTT) works

The goal of TechTree is to create a professional social network for Developers that helps to formally recognize the role they play in building the success and utility of the platform. We do this by rewarding behaviours that grow the platform and community and are historically seen as "free". Behaviours like sharing and creating. We also are turning historically free actions into investment actions where the user performing the action is investing in the platform and another user (see money shares and money likes below).

The platform helps Companies & Developer Tools to build relationships with Developers and ultimately create communities around their brands or participate in communities created by other users (and benefit from the reach and engagement they've managed to build).

The communities can be created around (1) individual users (2) companies (3) groups of companies - for example VC portfolios.

At the same time, we want to create our platform to reward:

* Creators for their contributions to the platform
* Developers for the attention they give (Developers are Viewers)
* Developers & Creators who share the platform with friends and help grow it and build its presence (are behaving as Sharers).

We believe that social media platforms are successful primarily because of their users. What "makes" them is the community created by the people using the platform, not the functional utility of the platform itself. And therefore we are sharing most of the value that is created on the platform with our users - in an as transparent and fair way as possible.

### Getting TTT (TechTree Token)

* Tokens will be initially listed on AMM decentralized exchanges like Uniswap and Fiat to Crypto on-ramps like Ramp Network
* You will earn TTT by being paid for your attention (being a Viewer) - reading an article, watching a video, attending an event
* All users will receive a small sign-up bonus for completing their profile
* Actions such as promoting TechTree via social media channels etc. will also be remunerated with the token
  * Every month part of the community pool would be shared between people depending on how successful they were in bringing new users to the site in a given period of time
  * There would be a cap for each individual in terms of the amount of money they can receive from a single distribution from the community pool
  * You need to stake TTT if you want to participate in the community pool distributions

### Community pool

TechTree will maintain a community pool of TTT that will be used to:

* Pay users for their attention (Viewer role)
* Reward Creators for attracting attention
* Reward users for setting up their accounts

The community pool will be continually topped up with the unfulfilled portions of bounty payments - see Value Sharing & Bounty mechanics below.

### How is TTT priced

The platform will be generating demand for the token by requiring Companies & DevTools to pay for products in TTT and to post bounties.

The Token itself will have natural deflationary characteristics baked in. For every million TTT that are purchased, the price will double with a maximum supply of 21M tokens.

### What can TTT be used for?

**Companies**

* Can add Bounties to [jobs they post](https://www.figma.com/file/O4On0uHSGlRW0XqX8XmZdD/Renown-Crypto?node-id=20%3A2721)
* Can put out content requests (an article / an event) with an attached bounty
* Can pay to sponsor an event
* Can pay to promote content or jobs
* Can pay to become a patron of a community
* Can put a bounty out for a speaker for an event they're planning

**Developers (see what are creator coins useful below)**

* Can money share articles videos, podcasts or events they like in exchange for creator coins
* Can money like, articles, videos, podcasts or events they like in exchange for creator coins
* Can pay to promote content they're written or created
* To pay for access or retain access to a community they're a part of in exchange for that community's creator coin
* To remain connected to a peer on the site after a certain amount of time in exchange for a portion of the other creator's coin
* To invest in a creator's coin because you respect their work and want to share more heavily in any value created by that creator on TechTree (you're investing in them)

## What are Creator Coins?

### All users have a Coin

All users will have their own creator coin by default. All organizations will also have their own token but this will be managed by TechTree as part of a custodial arrangement for the organisation or community.

As the Custodian TechTree will be three of five signatures of multi-sig wallets that we setup on behalf of communities and companies. In order for funds to be withdrawn/moved we'll require at least 2 signatures on a given transaction are from TechTree and one is from the entity with whom we have a custodial arrangement.

![](.gitbook/assets/image.png)

### What Are Creator Coins Useful For?

**Money Likes / Money Shares**

As listed above, Developers can back the creators they respect by money sharing and money liking their content. The money part is where the Developer buys some of their creator coin (akin to an investment) that will earn them the right to share in revenues that are linked to that creator's content.

The minimum price of a money share is consistent between creators. However, the number of creator coins you would receive for the money share or money like would fluctuate depending on how valuable the creator's coin is at the time. However, we would allow users to increase the amount they pay for a money share if they'd like to own more of that creator that is available per the minimum money share amount.

Creator coins are sold according to a bonding curve. So, if a user holds X creator coins they can return those coins to the creator contract where they'll be removed from the supply and in return will receive the appropriate amount of TTT that is now released by the creator coin contract according to a bonding curve.

**Money follows**

In order to follow certain users and subscribe to their feed and specific content, users might have to money follow a user which requires them to stake a certain amount of TTT in that creators' coin contract.

* Money follows would be a fixed price in USD so as not to fluctuate with the TT price
* This amount to follow a person could be set by the user

**Promotional content**

Certain pieces of content could be placed behind `creator coin` paywalls whereby in order to access it you need to stake a certain about of TTT in that creator's coin contract.

**Meaningful relationships**

Rather than having 10K+ connections (aka LinkedIn) we want TechTree to be a place where people's listed connections and their true ones. Therefore, we're considering a mechanism where in order to persist a connection after say 6 mths a user would be required to stake a certain amount of the other users' creator coin.

**True membership**

Equally, the same mechanism can be applied for membership to communities. Where after a certain amount of time members are required to stake TTT in the communities creator coin.

**Fans only commenting (money comments)**

In order to comment you need to stake a certain amount of creator token.

### How price of Creator Coins are determined

Coins are priced according to a bonding curve that follows the following form:

```jsx
Price in TTT = .003 * creator_coins_in_circulation^2
Price in USD = .003 * creator_coins_in_circulation^2 * ttt_price_in_usd
```

### **Cashing-out**

Users can cash out their creator tokens by selling them against TTT, which will trade on TT's website and secondary markets.

Whenever a user sells a creator token, the amount of TTT he gets back is a function of the share of creator tokens he owns. The greater the share, the more TTT he will get back. Therefore, if a creator is successful, its token yields more revenue/fees, and therefore the amount of TTT a user can redeem from the creator token will go up.

#### Bonding curve\*

| Creator coins in circulation | Creator coin price (USD) | USD locked in profile |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------ | --------------------- |
| 10                           | 0.75                     | 2.50                  |

\*based on TechTree Token price of **$2.50**

### Founder's Fee

Any transactions to buy creator coins will see 10% of the newly minted creator coins being sent to the creator coin's owner.

### Real Life examples

#### Hiring event

![](<.gitbook/assets/image (3).png>)

_Bounty is posted by a company_

A company creates a job posting and lists a total available reward of $16k

_Money share occurs_

Bob money shares a link to Alice's article. Carol clicks the link and arrives on TechTree. Carol creates an account and applies for the role and is accepted.

_Hire is confirmed_

The company confirms the hire and the $16k is distributed as follows:

* $10k for Referrer (no referrer so $10k goes to community pool)
* $6k for affiliates
  * $1k of TTT is used to buy Bob's creator coin as he is the sharer of Carol
  * $5k of TTT is used to buy Alice's creator coin and is distributed as follows:
    * 10% founders fee on $4k would go to the creator coin founder (Alice in this case) (£500 of their creator coin)
    * 90% of the $5k (eg $4.5k) would be distributed to the holders of Alice's creator coin in proportion to how much they already hold.

**Scenario B**

_Bounty is posted by company_

Company creates a job posting and lists a total available bounty of $16k

_Bob refers_

Bob refers Carol for a role. Carol receives the referral, clicks and joins TechTree for the first time.

_Hire is confirmed_

The company confirms the hire and the $16k is distributed as follows:

* $5k for the Referrer (in this case Bob)
* $5k for the Applicant (in this case Carol)
* $6k for affiliates:
  * $1k of TTT is used to buy Bob's creator coin as he is the Sharer of Carol
  * $5k of TTT goes to TechTree's community pool as there's no Creator linked to the application

#### Premium content

Alice creates a private group that requires attendees to buy a certain amount of Alice creator coin to participate and sets the bar at 0.1 Alice coins.

Bob buys 0.1 Alice coins in exchange for TTT being locked in the Alice coin contract.

Bob visits the group on TechTree and is granted access.

#### Patronage

A company pays a patronage bounty raised by a community (CodeFirstGirls) for $30k for a 1 year patronage arrangement.

Alice and Bob both own CodeFirstGirl's `creator coin`. Alice, Bob and all other holders of CodeFirstGirl creator coin receive a share of the $30k patronage fee in proportion to their current holding of CodeFirstGirl creator coin.

#### Watching an event

Bob tunes into to an Open Source your Knowledge - Dev Talk being run by Hopin's engineering team on TechTree.

Bob is online and active for the majority of the event so a Viewer event is triggered and Bob receives the system-set amount of Hopin's creator coin in return for attending the majority of the event.
