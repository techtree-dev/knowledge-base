## For Example

Let's say a super talented candidate is referred to your VC talent branch who is a great fit for one of your portfolio companies. The candidate applies and becomes an **Applicant**. This applicant is interviewed for a senior-level position at the portfolio company that carries a £10,000 bounty. The interview process goes well and the candidate is hired. The individual who referred the applicant becomes a **Referrer** and is entitled to the £10,000 bounty. Let us assume the referrer decides to split the bounty 70:30 with the applicant who was hired. The total cost to the portfolio company will look like this:
