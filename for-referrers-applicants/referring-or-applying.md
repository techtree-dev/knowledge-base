# Referring or applying

TechTree is a hiring marketplace that rewards users and their network for helping companies hire tech people.

1. **Find bounties**: Go to [techtree.dev/bounties](https://techtree.dev/bounties) to see bounties or find bounties via a dev or dev teams bounty board.
2. **Choose the role**: Pick which role or role(s) you want to explore with your network. Do you have a friend or former colleague that sounds like a great fit for a role? Have you come across someone‚Äôs background or portfolio recently who‚Äôs a good match? See an opportunity that sounds too good to pass up for yourself?
3. **Refer/ Apply**: Click "Refer" or "Apply" and fill a short form. If you're refer, your friend will receive an email from TechTree but you can also share the tracked referral link with them via whatsapp or similar.
4. **Activate**: You will receive an e-mail in order to activate and setup up your TechTree account. We'll be adding tracking to your account dashboard shortly so see the status of applications and referrals, as well as track any bounty claims that are connected to tracked links you've shared.
5. **Wait to get paid**: 90 days after your candidate starts on the job, you get paid the bounty. This is kind of the industry standard, right? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
