# Examples

First, let's remember there are up to 4 [roles ](../roles-at-techtree/)(applicant, referrer, sharer, creator) and up to 4 [types of fees](../for-companies/pricing.md) in the claim chain for a bounty. This depends on the following cases:

### **Case 1 - Referrer and Applicant**

![](../.gitbook/assets/Case1Applicant.png)

Imagine Alice is on TechTree and sees a job on a Bounty Board with a bounty of **$10,000** ðŸ’°.  Alice thinks her friend, Bob would be a great fit for this role. **Alice** becomes a **Referrer** and sends Bob a tracked link for the role. Alice also decides to split the bounty 70:30 with Bob.

Bob thinks the role is right up their street and applies. **Bob** has become an **Applicant**. Because Bob and the role are a match made in Heaven, Bob is hired. Alice and Bob split the bounty between them because this type of friendship should be rewarded!

This is what the transaction should look like:

| Player           | Reward Category | Reward ðŸ’° |
| ---------------- | --------------- | --------- |
| Alice (Referrer) | Bounty          | $7,000    |
| Bob (Applicant)  | Bounty          | $3,000    |



### **Case 2 - Sharer, Referrer and Applicant**

Charlie is looking for a role for himself on Techtree. However, he finds a super interesting role at WayFlyer that could be good for anyone in his network, so he clicks share which generates a personalised tracked link for Charlie that points at the role he wants to share. **Charlie** has become a **Sharer**.

Charlie shares the link with his twitter audience and Alice follows it. Alice sees a role at WayFlyer with a $10,000 bounty ðŸ’°. Alice knows Wayflyer, and Alice knows her friend Bob (who is a product designer) is looking for a new gig so she refers Bob. **Alice** has become a **Referrer**.&#x20;

Bob receives a referral link from Alice via WhatsApp and clicks follows it to the Wayflyer role on TechTree. **Bob** applies for the role and becomes an **Applicant**.

A short time later, Bob is invited to interview. Impresses the WayFlyer team and is hired. After 2 mths (60 days) has passed if Bob is still working with Wayflyer the full rewards will be distributed to all claimants.

**The Workings**

| Player           | Reward Category | Reward ðŸ’° |
| ---------------- | --------------- | --------- |
| Alice (Referrer) | Bounty          | $7,000    |
| Bob (Applicant)  | Bounty          | $3,000    |
| Charlie (Sharer) | Sharer Fee      | $1,000    |



### **Case 3 - Creator, Sharer, Referrer and Applicant**

![](../.gitbook/assets/Case3Applicant.png)

Satoshi Nakamoto joins TechTree and posts an article about cryptography. **Satoshi** has become a **Creator**.

Charlie follows Satoshi and sees his article in his feed. Charlie clicks share which generates a personalised tracked link for Charlie that points at Satoshi's article. **Charlie** has become a **Sharer**.

Charlie shares the link with Alice who follows it. Whilst Alice is reading Satoshi's article she sees a role at WayFlyer with a $10,000 bounty ðŸ’°. Alice knows Wayflyer, and Alice knows her friend Bob (who is a product designer) is looking for a new gig so she refers Bob. **Alice** has become a **Referrer**.&#x20;

Bob receives a referral link from Alice via WhatsApp and clicks follows it to the Wayflyer role on TechTree. **Bob** applies for the role and becomes an **Applicant**.

A short time later, Bob is invited to interview. Impresses the WayFlyer team and is hired. After 2 months (60 days) has passed if Bob is still working with Wayflyer the full rewards will be distributed to all claimants.
